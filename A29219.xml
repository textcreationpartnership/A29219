            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I may eaſily apprehend that ſome will not be wanting, who will look upon theſe Lines with an evil Eye, and argue from worſe Principles than thoſe of Logick, that I am proud and preſumptuous in making uſe of Your Name in this ſort; yet upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, I have adventured ſo to do, reſolving rather to run the hazard of their hardeſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than to neglect ſo fit an opportunity of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying to the World my Humble Reſpects to Your Honour, and my grateful thoughts of Your manifold favours towards Me and Mine.</p>
            <p>To ſee ſome Men live, as if Hell and its
<pb facs="tcp:54321:3"/>
Everlaſting Sorrows were but Scarecrows, and Melancholy Fancies, and (then) to ſee others hardening them in their Infidel impieties, by making them believe that it is ſo indeed; (And that they have gotten the knowledge of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Doctrine, by praying to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as my <hi>Author</hi> pretends very ſmoothly in his <hi>Preface</hi>) This (my Lord) is ſufficient to provoke a patient and peaceable ſpirit; The diſpleaſure of my Heart againſt his Execrable <hi>Book,</hi> hath now engaged my Pen againſt it; And (with the <hi>Poetical</hi> liberty) I may truly ſay—<hi>Si natura negat, facit indignatio Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, it is great pity that a Book of this kind I deal with, ſhould paſs one Year to an end, without a full and formal Confutation; And I was almoſt ready to Write a Satyr againſt my many Betters, (that have a great deal more Learning, and a little more leiſure than my ſelf) for ſuffering it to go ſo long without Controul.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:54321:3"/>
            <p>Well, I have now (through Providence) finiſhed that Work which they ſhould have done long before: For a Pamphlet of this nature muſt needs be as worthy of a ſevere Reproof, as thoſe Pieces that have been licenſed by his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they have ſo often, and ſo excellently oppoſed; For 'tis worſe to believe Hell a Dream, than to believe <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be a Real thing.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>(Right Honourable)</hi> beſides my Obligations to You, it may ſeem in other reſpects very proper to preſent You with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this ſort; becauſe the Reality of Hell thus Proved, Defended and Applied, may by God's help make You ſtill more and more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of that great Work, which I perſwade my ſelf Your Honour is truly careful of already, <hi>viz.</hi> To lead Others in the way to Heaven, by Your good Example.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:54321:4"/>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus multiply his choiceſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon Your Self, Your Virtuous Lady, and the reſt of Your Family, granting You height of Honour, and length of Days, the real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Holy Ordinances, and the Eternal Felicities of his Father's Houſe.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>CHriſtian Reader, It was the Apoſtle's predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that in the latter dayes perillous times ſhould come;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim 3.1.</note> which I think, hath been more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently verified in this laſt Age: And no wonder, ſince ſo many perillous Books have been publiſhed (year by year) to pervert the Faith, and corrupt the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Chriſtian world. Of which I might name a great many; but there is ſcarce any for the bigneſs of it, more eminet in this kind, than this of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> which I have undertaken (by God's aſſiſtance) to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and Confute. For though many could wiſh that there were no Hell, nor Everlaſting puniſhment for the Wicked and Impenitent, yet there be few or none that have ſaid ſo, with ſo much confidence as my <hi>Author</hi> hath done.</p>
            <p>I Confeſs (to give the Devil his due) ſome of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Worthies have ſuggeſted ſomething of this Nature,<note place="margin">Vid. Calov. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. proflig. de Morte aeterna.</note> and ſometimes have pretended a Reaſon or two for it. But none of them (that I know of) did ever ſpeak it ſo roundly, or take ſo much pains to
<pb facs="tcp:54321:5"/>
prove it as he hath done. —Rejoyce (in ſin) O ye unrighteous, and be glad all ye that are hollow in heart, Triumph and boaſt O ye Enemy of Holineſs, and let your hearts be hardened againſt the fear of evil; come now and take your fill of what you moſt love, and walk (ſecurely) in the ways of your own hearts; go oft to the Ale-houſe, and ſeldom to Gods houſe; let Cards be more with you than Bibles, and be wiſer (now) than to mind that Melancholy thing which Preciſe fools call by the name of Religion and the Fear of God; in ſhort, ſet a Cup on your Table, and a Whore on your Knees, and ſing aloud your baſeſt <hi>Epithalamiums,</hi> and profaneſt Songs that you have, yea, let them delight your honeſt Souls day by day; for what though theſe things are known in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and offend (moſt grievouſly) your glorious Lord; yet the matter is not much as to any great danger therein; for your Preachers ſad Doctrines are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Deluſions: you need not to fear any Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Damnation, however you live or however you die. For this good Gentleman hath given you many Infallible proofs, that there is no ſuch thing to be feared. (ſee the latter part of his Book.)</p>
            <p>But yet, Take heed ſinners, and do not bleſs your ſelves overmuch in your iniquities, for what if this Learned man ſhould be miſtaken, and his Infallible Proofs ſhould prove to be nothing but fair ſhews and real Deceits, what a caſe would you then be in, if you
<pb facs="tcp:54321:5"/>
ſhould die as you have lived? And that they are ſuch, and no better, I for my part do verily believe: And if thou canſt doubt of it <hi>(Chriſtian Reader)</hi> be pleaſed to compare his <hi>Proofs</hi> and my <hi>Anſwers</hi> together.</p>

            <p>Miſtake me not, <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſpeak not this,<note place="margin">A Digreſſion of Mr. <hi>Chewney</hi> his Book.</note> in any meaſure to undervalue that piece which Mr. <hi>N. Chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> hath oppoſed unto it. But let theſe particulars be conſidered in the caſe. 1. That it is very ſmall, and 2. ſo general that there is need enough of another Book to that purpoſe, for it is not a fourth part of his ſubtilties which he hath engaged with therein (and I think I may ſay, it is ſcarce a tenth part.) And the Reaſon why He did not Confute his falſe Gloſſes and fair pretences more particularly, is; as he tells us in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> becauſe he thought them to be very Obvious to every Judicious eye (to uſe his own words in that place.) But with due reſpect to his Name and Works, he might eaſily have conſidered, that a Pamphlet of this nature, was not deſigned to
<pb facs="tcp:54321:6"/>
deceive the Judicious, but rather the ignorant and unſtable. And if it do but ſo, and ſo harden ſuch perſons in their ſinful courſes, <hi>Satan</hi> will not think that he hath ſowed his Tares in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What if others can do it better than I, yet it will be nevertheleſs lawful for me to do it as I can. Muſt I reſolve to lay down my Miniſtry, and to Preach no more, becauſe I cannot Preach ſo well as they that can Preach better? No ſure, no reaſon for it. Doubtleſs I may (and muſt) do my Lord and Maſter what Service I can, though I cannot do what others can.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Others can do it better (thou ſaiſt, and I do not gainſay it) But I rather look what men will do, than what they can do. If they can ſave us from Drowning (when we are fallen into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) yet if they will not do it, we are never the more beholding to them. And if they can, 'tis their own fault that they did not, or at leaſt it was not mine, for I did not hinder them from ſo doing.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have, though too haſtily, read over Your Book; for which You deſerve many Thanks from him, who is your Adverſary; and do hereby receive them from me, who am a friend to you, and every man elſe who is of your Complexion; I mean, a Lover of Virtue, and a defender of Truth. It is my Opinion, that you have much obliged both Your Antagoniſt, and Your Reader; Your Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, by convincing him of his Error; Your Reader, if already Orthodox, by confirming him in a great Article of his Faith. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Cavils of that Pamphlet, wherewith you deal, are ſo weak and fond; ſo clearly Confuted by thoſe ſtrong Arguments which you have produced from Scriptures and Reaſon; that if the Author of that worthleſs Scroll ſhall not, upon his ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of Your Book, ſubſcribe to that Truth, which therein you have aſſerted; 'tis much to be feared, that his obſtinate perſeverance in ſo foul an Error, againſt ſuch clear Convictions, will ere long bring him to that place, which he now denieth, and make him ſenſible by ſad experience, that there is indeed an Hell.</p>
            <p>Who this Perſon is, I cannot tell; perhaps a Sceptick, perhaps a downright Atheiſt, and probably a man of a lewd and vicious Converſation; for, the Truth is, ſuch perſons are moſt concerned to believe, and, were it poſſible, to prove, that there is no Hell, who have no ground to expect any ſhare in Heaven. But whoſoever your Opponent may be, I have ſo much Charity for his Immortal Soul, as to wiſh that he may reap that Advantage from your Book, which therein you deſign him; that he may timely ſee his groſs miſtake, and renounce his Hereſie; leſt hereafter he be forced to confeſs an Eternity of Torments, when it will be too late to eſcape them. So Prayeth,</p>

                     </gap>) in this following Method. 1. To lay down ſome Arguments to prove the Everlaſting Puniſhment of the wicked (that live and dye ſuch.) 2. To examine the ſaid Book, in all the principal parts and paſſages of it, (for it will not be worth while to ſpeak of all he hath written, there being very many Impertinencies in it.) 3. To improve the Doctrine in a practical way, for Inſtruction, Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I ſpeak of either of theſe, it may ſeem needful to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Author</hi> of this precious Piece, which I am to deal with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Who the Author was.</note>If any Man ſhould ask me who it was, I would anſwer, It was <hi>(O Grande nomen!)</hi> Mr. <hi>S.

                     </note>. And therefore ſome may imagine I have been too venturous, to engage (voluntarily) with ſo great a Champion as He: But yet <hi>Reader,</hi> I am not diſcouraged; I hope to come off clear, and to paſs without hurt through all the Pikes of his Arguments and Subtilties; for <hi>God</hi> and his Truth are greater and ſtronger than Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and his Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. — But to return to that which I was ſpeaking of; I ſay it was He whom the World is ſo much beholding to for the Book I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. For I have ſeen his Name prefixed to it, though it be not ſet in that Edition of it which I have, (and perhaps it might be as good policy to conceal his Name in the ſecond Edition, as it was to mention it in the former.</p>

                        <hi>2.</hi> What he was.</note>But though it may be eaſily gained what his Name was, yet it may be more difficult to diſcover what Himſelf was. I remember the old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Noſcitur ex ſocio, &amp;c.</hi> A dark Fellow is to be expounded by his Companions.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54321:12"/>
                  <p>It might be queſtioned whether Mr. <hi>R.</hi> were himſelf of any Religion, for all Religions have a Hell in their Creed, and yet he hath none in his; wherefore his Opinion concludes him of the doubtful gender in point of Religion, ſo that we muſt be forced (as was ſaid) to expound him by his Companions. And if you would know who they were, and what Perſwaſion they were of, you may fitly conſult the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, Printed <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1644. which that<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Featly.</hi>

                  <p>THE fitteſt Method of procedure in my preſent Deſign ſeems to be that which is mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contended for, (before I meddle with the main Body of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> his Sophiſtical Argumentations) namely that aboveſaid.</p>
                  <p>And herein I do not undertake to convince the <hi>Atheist,</hi> or drive him out of his Reſolved Infidelity; but rather to confirm the Chriſtian in the Belief of this Doctrine, which he hath been ſo often put in mind of by his Teachers.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt Argument that I would propoſe,<note place="margin">Scripture-Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Argument.</note> is the Teſtimony of God in Scripture; and that is indeed the ſtrongeſt of all Arguments, and the moſt convincing to the Soul and Conſcience.

                     </note> for God to be falſe in his Word, implies a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. And there is nothing more natural to a Man in his right Wits, than to conceive his Maker to be True in all that he ſaith, or revealeth.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we have the Teſtimony of God for it in his written Word, we may ſafely build upon it.</p>

                  <p>I ſay, if we have the Teſtimony of God in his written Word, for the Doctrine I aſſert, then we may be bold to believe it, and muſt believe it, though Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and his Companions in Infidelity ſhould write never ſo many Books againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou doſt not believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, (or knoweſt but little reaſon why thou ſhould'ſt believe ſo) then I would adviſe thee to read thoſe that may confute thy unbelief, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thy faith in that particular, as Biſhop <hi>Ward</hi>'s Sermon againſt Anti-ſcripturiſts, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Orig.

                  <p>But if thou doſt believe it to be ſo, I truſt thou wilt believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I plead for: For, the Scripture teſtifies of it, in words as plain as can be deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> — in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. laſt verſe, and many other places.</p>

                  <p>What can ever be ſpoken more plain, or more plainly to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than this is, <hi>They ſhall go away into Everlasting Puniſhment,</hi>

And theſe words are the words of Him who was (and is) the Son of the Father, and moſt perfectly acquainted with his Counſels, Purpoſes, Truths and Ways, and had no need to fright the wicked World with ſuch a ſad Doctrine, if it were not a Truth.</p>
                  <p>This is that <hi>Marpeſian Rock</hi> which Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> was not able to faſten his Teeth in, yet nevertheleſs,<note place="margin">

                  <q>

                  <p>But here our Lord ſpeaks not of the <hi>Fire of Tophet,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.4.</note> yet it is no where ſaid, that he was under <hi>Everlaſting Affliction.</hi>

                  <p>This is the ſubſtance of that which he ſaith in the greateſt part of the 19. Page of his Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Removed.</label> And it is eaſily removed out of the way. Let us put it into a form of Arguing, and it will be exactly thus: [The word <hi>Everlaſting</hi> in ſome places is uſed to ſignifie but a limited time, therefore it muſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

juſt the ſame, when 'tis ſpoken of the Puniſhment of the wicked, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. laſt verſe.]</p>
                  <p>Now were not this a pitiful way of reaſoning, and moſt apparently inconſequent?

If he Cavil about the word [Deſtruction] and pretend it is meant of the Deſtruction of their Beings (by turning them into nothing) then we may ſee ſomething to the contrary, in the three latter parts of the laſt Section (in Anſwer to the <hi>Socinians;</hi>) To which I ſhall now add theſe Three particulars.</p>

Deſtruction is not uſed in Scripture (in reference to Men) to ſignifie any ſuch thing, as the Total aboliſhment of their Natures. Let any of my Author's Opinion diſprove this by any Text whatſoever. Indeed 'tis ſaid of the old World, that the <hi>Flood came,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24.39.</note> 
                     <hi>and took them all away;</hi> but 'tis [<hi>omnes</hi> only, not <hi>totos</hi>] it took away All thoſe Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Land of the Living: But it did not take away the whole Natures. Their Souls are living ſtill. And God will be ſo far from deſtroying the Souls of the wicked, (as to their Nature and Being) as that he will quicken and raiſe their Bodies, which Death and Worms had deſtroyed formerly.<note place="margin">Acts 24.15.</note> 
                     <hi>There ſhall be a Reſurrection of the just and the unjust,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts.</hi> And they ſhall be raiſed for good and all, as we ſay, ſo as to ſee corruption no more for ever.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.52.</note>

That [to deſtroy] ſignifies (in reſpect of the wicked) a ſtate of real Miſery and Torment; as when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.28.</note> that <hi>God is able to deſtroy Body and Soul in Hell:</hi> that is, to fill them with perfect Miſery: And if it were meant of deſtroying their Beings, then that dreadful word [Hell] which is added as an aggravation of the deſtruction, would ſignifie juſt nothing in point of Terror: for if a Man be turned into nothing, it is all one whether it be in the one or the other. (for <hi>nothing</hi> is no nearer to <hi>ſomething,</hi> in Heaven than in Hell.)</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo the word is uſed very often in our own Language: As when we ſay of Oppreſſors, that they have deſtroyed whole Families, we do not mean that they have turned them into nothing, but that they have brought them into a calamitous condition. And this, I hope, may be enough for that Text, and I think it is not too much.</p>

                     </note>)</p>
                  <p>A fourth Text of Scripture, which may conveniently be urged, for [the everlaſtingneſs of the puniſhment of the wicked] is <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.2.<note place="margin">Daniel 12.2. <hi>urged and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</hi>

                     <hi>Many that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I come to ſpeak of that which moſt directly concerns my preſent purpoſe,<note place="margin">Many] how underſtood.</note> it will not be amiſs to explain the word [many] for ſome have gathered from thence, that there ſhall be no general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The weakneſs of which Opinion (to ſpeak no worſe of it) I might ſhew from a great many places. Theſe two, for brevity ſake, I ſhall content my ſelf with: <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>The hour is coming,</hi> wherein <hi>All that are in the Grave ſhall hear his Voice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo. 5.29.</note> 
                     <hi>and come forth, &amp;c.</hi> So then, there are none excepted. And in the 24. chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it was the Apoſtles belief,<note place="margin">Acts 24.15.</note> 
                     <hi>That there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the juſt and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt:</hi> that is, of all and every one of them: for if the juſt there do mean All the juſt; the unjuſt muſt mean All the unjuſt, for the phraſe is alike of both of them: ſo that he that grants the one, may not deny the other. And therefore that Text in <hi>Daniel</hi> cannot tend to ſtrengthen that Opinion; which that we may the better perceive, theſe <hi>three</hi> things may be conſidered. 1. That the [<hi>Multi ex dormientibus,</hi> many of them that ſleep,<note place="margin">vid. Synopſ crit. in loc.</note> is in ſubſtance the ſame, as if it were ſaid [<hi>Multi dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mientes, i. e.</hi> Thoſe many that are ſleeping in the Duſt of the Earth. And then it will be no leſs, than if it were ſaid, All of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54321:18"/>2. That the Propoſition is particular only, and therefore will not warrant a Univerſal Negative to be inferred from it. Many Saints, or Multitudes of Saints, <hi>ſhall be caught up together,</hi> to meet the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.17.</note> at his coming to Judgment, is a Truth. Yet we cannot truly conclude that All ſhall not. Doubtleſs their Lord will receive them all, as well as any. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no difference between himſelf and the reſt of the faithful, in reſpect of that priviledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Many] ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put for All.</note> By the word [many] we may (by a very uſual figure) underſtand [All], and ſo we find it is put for All, in ſeveral Texts of Holy Writ. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth</hi> be glad; <hi>let the multitudes of the Iſles,</hi> or the many Iſles, <hi>be glad thereof: i. e.</hi> let all Countries be glad of it. (Let all the faithful in all Nations comfort themſelves by the thoughts of his Soveraignty and Dominion over all.) So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Through the diſobedience of one,</hi> (viz. <hi>Adam) many were made ſinners: viz.</hi> All thoſe that deſcended from him in a Natural way.</p>
                  <p>And if any that are dead (or ſleeping in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſhould not awake, and ariſe hereafter, it muſt be the wicked, (for that's our Adverſary's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the caſe) but that cannot be ſuppoſed, nor cannot ſtand with the truth of this Text, which tells us, that ſome (of thoſe many) ſhall ariſe to everlaſting ſhame and contempt.</p>
                  <p>Which is moſt direct for my purpoſe: And ſo plain, that I cannot gueſs any thing that can, with any ſhew of reaſon, be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, If the wicked ſhall awake to everlaſting contempt,<note place="margin">The proof of the point from <hi>Dan. 12.</hi>
                     </note> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but they muſt remain as to their Natures and Perſonal Beings, and not be annihilated. And ſecondly, If they awake to everlaſting contempt and ſhame, it muſt needs follow that they ſhall be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under ſhame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in caſe Mr. <hi>R.</hi> his Book againſt Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould bring his name into perpetual reproach among Chriſtians, it muſt needs be perpetually under reproach. (And the everlaſting ſhame is everlaſting in the ſame ſenſe, as the glory (of the righteous) in the ſame verſe is everlaſting) — And thus I have proved the everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked in another World, from ſeveral Scriptures. See alſo to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.47. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20.20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and many more,<note place="margin">Rev. 14.11.</note> which thy own Reading may furniſh thee with.</p>
                  <p>And thus having proved the Point by ſeveral Texts of Scripture,<note place="margin">Some Scripture Arguments for the Doctrine.</note> I ſhall now add <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> ſome Scripture-Arguments to confirm it. And the firſt is this: The wicked and impenitent ſhall always (or to all Eternity) have a Being: But they ſhall not have a Being in Joy and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54321:19"/>
nor in a middle ſtate between Happineſs and Miſery: therefore they ſhall always have a Being in Miſery and Torment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> From the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingneſs of their Being.</note>The Major (or firſt) Propoſition is eaſie to be proved: For firſt, The <hi>Dead</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed incorruptible,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. What Dead doth he mean? ſurely all of them, ſince he makes no diſtinction between one ſort and another in this reſpect. As when it is ſaid, that <hi>the Sea ſhall give up her Dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The wicked ſhall always have a Being.</note> that is, all her Dead. And if we ſhall ſuppoſe that it muſt be meant only of the Dead Saints, (or as the Scripture calls it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.52.</note> 
                     <hi>the Dead in Christ</hi>) then it might be ſaid as properly, that the Dead ſhall not be raiſed incorruptible, for we might mean it of the wicked that are Dead; yea, it might be more properly ſaid ſo; for the wicked that are dead, are many more than the Saints that are dead: (becauſe moſt of the Living never were Saints indeed) Now the Denomination being to be given from the greater part, I ſee no Reaſon why it might not more fitly be ſaid, [The Dead ſhall not be raiſed incorruptible] than to ſay the contrary, if only the dead Saints ſhould be raiſed. Nor hath my Author, or any for him, ever been ſo reſolute, as to affirm, the word Dead, to ſignifie the Saints more than the wicked.— And their Souls being immortal, we cannot think that God will unite them at Judgment to Mortal Bodies: If God had meant that the Bodies of the wicked, after the Day of Judgment, ſhould dye again, (in a proper ſenſe) ſurely he would not raiſe them at that Day from their Graves. If Death and Deſtruction of their Fleſh were the great wrath they were to lye under, the Worms would be ſufficient Executioners of his wrath upon them. What need any ſuch Miracle be wrought upon them, as the quickning and raiſing of their putrified Bodies, if he intended they ſhould dye and corrupt again?</p>
                  <p>So then, the firſt Propoſition is certain, that the wicked themſelves ſhall be raiſed to an Immortal ſtate at the Day of Judgment. (They that would come but ſeldome to the Church, ſhall not have the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lye always in the Grave; they ſhall be remembred in that bond of forgetfulneſs, and not dye like Bruits, though they lived like ſuch.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The wicked ſhall not be happy to Eternity.</note>The ſecond thing to be proved, is this, [That the wicked ſhall not have a Being in Happineſs, after the Day of Judgment.] This I need not be large in proving to them, that know any thing of Holy Scripture. They <hi>ſhall come forth to the Reſurrection of Damnation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.28, 29.</note> (which will be far enough from all Happineſs in the leaſt degree; though they were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough when they were Damning and Sinking on Earth, yet they will be ſorrowful enough, when their Damned Petition is granted, when they ſink irrecoverably into Damnation it ſelf, when inſtead of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54321:19"/>
thinking themſelves Companions for Gentlemen, they will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves companions for Devils) Damnation doubtleſs will deſtroy all joys whatſoever,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> and the curſe that ſhall be on them will ſeclude all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.—Nor ſhall they be in a middle ſtate between Happineſs and Miſery after the Day of Judgment, for there is no ſuch middle ſtate thought of by any ſober Chriſtians, nor ſo much as dream'd of by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, (whatſoever properties <hi>Purgatory</hi> may have in it before the Day of Judgment, yet they hold it ſhall ceaſe for ever after that Day, and nothing remain but Heaven and Hell, and Joy and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the places and portions of reaſonable Creatures.) And this conceipt is abundantly confuted by what hath been ſaid already; for Wrath and Damnation and the Curſe are, or imply a proper ſtate of Miſery, not a middle ſtate between Miſery and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Conſequence is clear as the Light:<note place="margin">The Conſeq. cleared.</note> for if the wicked ſhall always have a Being after the Day of Judgment, and yet never have a Being in Happineſs; then it muſt needs follow, that they muſt have a Being always in Miſery and Torment. And this, I think, is a plain Argument, and that which follows is no leſs plain, being taken from the nature of Divine Juſtice. It is thus, good <hi>Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Divine Juſtice requires that the Wicked that continue ſuch,<note place="margin">A ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from God's Juſtice. <hi>1.</hi> Cleared.</note> ſhould be puniſhed for ever. Therefore they ſhall be puniſhed for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence will not be denied. The Antecedent is proved thus. If the wicked are always worthy of Puniſhment for their Wickedneſs, then Juſtice requires that they ſhould always have it; for it is the part of Juſtice to render what is deſerved. But the wicked (ſuppoſing them to have a Being always after the Day of Judgment, as was proved juſt before) muſt needs be always worthy of Puniſhment.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi>

'Tis not unknown, what Miſeries ſin brought upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when he ſtood in the place of ſinners: It made him ſweat as it were drops of Bloud, it made his Body ſubject to Buffettings, Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, Wounds and Death, yea a ſhameful and accurſed Death:<note place="margin">Matth. 27.

                     </note> it made his name ſubject to reproaches and Accuſations, and bittereſt Scoffs and Taunts from the baſeſt and wickedeſt men; It made his Soul to be full of Sorrow, though it were free from all ſpot of ſin. It made him a man of Sorrows on Earth, who is the Matter of Heavens Joy: It made him to be deſpiſed and rejected of men, and live a life of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Perſecutions, who is the object of the Angels Worſhip, and at whoſe Birth they ſang <hi>A Hymn of Praiſe.</hi> Thus we ſee what Miſeries he bore, when he undertook for ſinners, and <hi>bare their ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.</p>

                  <p>Now if Chriſt ſuffered ſo much, when he undertook for them that in time ſhould repent, (if they came to years) how great muſt that puniſhment be, which the Impenitent muſt bear when they muſt anſwer for themſelves?

Will it not fill the Hypocrites hollow heart with vexation to think with himſelf what a ſilly Diſſembler he hath been, to remember what care he took to deceive others, and what pains he uſed to deceive himſelf, and how careleſs he was of that time which was given him to prepare for Eternity? Will it not torment the Drunkard, to think how he ſerved the Devil till he could not ſtand on his Legs, how he valued a Barrel above Heaven, and the company of Sots, before communion with Chriſt in his ways, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In a word: when a reaſonable creature comes to ſee that he hath been his own Ruine (by following the ways of his own heart) and hath loſt at once the world and Heaven by his wilful wickedneſs, (when he was alſo warned of the danger time after time, and beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn that he might be ſaved) who knows whether this very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his former follies, as the Means and Cauſes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Miſeries, will not be as great a Torment to him as hell-fire it ſelf?

                  <p>HAving laid down ſome Proofs of the Doctrine aſſerted, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated thoſe Proofs from Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and his Fellow's Evaſions and Exceptions; I ſhall now proceed, with God's permiſſion and aſſiſtance, to examine his Book, and encounter the Enemies of this Truth, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great or ſmall) that are to be found therein. And though we may call them <hi>Legion,</hi> for that they are many, yet I truſt thou wilt find, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in due ſeaſon, that their united ſtrength is far enough from being inſuperable. My <hi>Author</hi> was wiſe enough to foreſee, that all good Chriſtians would not have a good Opinion of Him, or his Work, and therefore ſuppoſeth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that (in this unthankful Age) thoſe that are in the Dark themſelves, might reject and undervalue the new Light he hath afforded them, and ſay of Him, as ſome did of Chriſt, <hi>[He hath a Devil, and is mad, why hear ye him.]</hi> And truly, if they ſhall ſay ſo of him, I ſhall not much reprove them for it. For in the entrance of his Book, he writes as though madneſs were in his heart, as 'tis expreſſed in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes;</hi> As though a Spirit of vanity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency had guided his valiant Pen: For he begins with a diſcourſe of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Deſcent into Hell, and ſeems to pleaſe himſelf abundantly in ſetting his Betters at variance with each other, I mean by reckoning up
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54321:23"/>
the different Expoſitions of that Article amongſt Proteſtant Divines: And what (I pray you) is that to the purpoſe he aims at? For what if <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> were not altogether of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Bucer,</hi> and others, as to the ſenſe of that Article, yet 'tis ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known, that they were far from thinking with Mr. <hi>R.</hi> that there is no Hell, nor no Everlaſting Puniſhment for the Wicked hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Or what if Hell (in that Article) do not ſignifie the place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Enemies of God, yet how will it follow that it doth not ſignifie ſuch a thing in thoſe places, where mention is made of Hell-fire, and of deſtroying Body and Soul in Hell, and the like? To his Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency may be added his Impiety; for I find not any thing of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the place cited out of Dr. <hi>Fulk,</hi> (his Defence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation) which he alledgeth for His, in the 5. Page of his Book.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he brings in the Opinions of ſome learned Men about the word <hi>Sheol,</hi> which is as much to the purpoſe, as the other. He tells us, that it ſometimes ſignifies the Grave (and what thanks ſhall we give him for ſuch a diſcovery) but yet, alas, he had not ſhewed more of his Learning, in the two former Pages, than he hath ſhewed of his folly in two Lines following, (in <hi>p.</hi> 11.) where he tells us, that <hi>Sheol</hi> cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Hell, in their ſpeech, that believe there is no Hell. As much as if he had ſaid [The Devil is not conceived to be an Enemy to Mankind, by thoſe that believe there is no Devil; (which hath been the Ale-houſe Doctrine of ſome Damners and Sinkers in our days) And then he adds, [The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay plainly, that Mens Souls ſhall vaniſh like ſmoke:] If they do, the more ignorant are they, and if <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men think ſo too, they would be ſo much the fitter to hear and believe the Doctrine of his Book (which is no better than the other:) His Head hath as much of Atheiſm in it, which can (by the force of imagination) turn Hell into a Dream, and Everlaſting Puniſhment into a Bug-bear and Scare-crow, as he that fancies the Soul to be turned into ſmoke.

this, that it ſpeaks nothing diſtinctly concerning its ſcituation; In what part of the World it is placed, how far diſtant from the Sun or Stars, or what compaſs it is of, or the like; But doth not mean that it ſpeaks nothing of that place, which is commonly called by that Name, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture aſſures us, that there was a Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2.8.</note> in which Man was placed, yet I might ſay without abſurdity, That it ſpeaks nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of that place, for it tells us only that it was Eaſt-ward, (in the general) but ſaith not what part of the World it was in; how long, or how broad, or how near to the place where <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtood, or the like.

As the word which notes a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Perſon, is fitly uſed to ſignifie the Devil, as was noted before. And that the caſting into Hell-fire cannot ſignifie the caſting into the Fire of <hi>Hinnom</hi> aforeſaid, is manifeſt; becauſe that Fire had been put out long ago, and the place turned to another uſe, by the good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> as we find in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.10.</p>

                     </note>Having pleaſed his Humour upon the word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> in the 16. and 17. Pages, (to as little profit to himſelf, or his <hi>Reader,</hi> as can well be deſired) He proceeds in the following Pages, to darken the Light of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54321:24"/>
the word [Everlaſting] from thence to the 22 page of his Book,<note place="margin">p. 16, 17. and 23.</note> which they that admire for good and ſound, may conveniently Read the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, where I have examined them ſeverally: This, Reader, I thought fit to mention, that thou mayſt not think I do wilfully paſs over any thing in his Pamphlet that is not groſly impertinent. Then in the 23 page, he paſſeth his grave cenſure upon that Text in St. <hi>Luke</hi> cap. 16. concerning the Rich man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> where he tells us that it is but a Parable.— And that I am confident, was no new diſcovery of his own, it was found out long before the world had any benefit by this Book of his. Then (having time and paper to ſpare) he undertakes to prove it by no leſs than Ten Reaſons (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> of old urged 30 Arguments againſt Infant Baptiſm,) But as all theirs were deceitful arguments, ſo Nine of his Ten Reaſons, are needleſs ones, for in ſuch a caſe one may be ſufficient. And when he hath gained what he contends for, [that it is a Parable,] yet he hath gained very little as to the cauſe he hath undertaken.</p>
                  <p>For as the Learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith very well — If that of the Rich man in Hell, and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſhould be no more than a Parable,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Saints Reſt.</hi> part 2. cap. 10. Sect. 4.</note> yet it ſeems very unlikely, that Chriſt would teach them by ſuch a Parable as ſeemed ſo evidently to intimate the Souls Happineſs or Miſery imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after death, if there were no ſuch thing — So ſay I in like manner, it were very ſtrange that Chriſt ſhould teach them by ſuch a Parable, as ſeems ſo plainly to intimate a Hell or Torment for the Souls of the ungodly that dye ſuch (though they dye Rich) if there were no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>The next place of Scripture he hath taken a view of is <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.33.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of Tophet,</hi> Eſay 30.33. p. 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> where he tells us we muſt underſtand by <hi>Tophet,</hi> only the Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> aforeſaid. This he enlargeth upon, to little purpoſe, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pages together, but that is the ſubſtance of his diſcourſe, ſo far as it oppoſeth my Doctrine: (and where he doth not oppoſe the Truth, I can let him alone very contentedly) nor need I be large upon this point, we have enough for the upholding the Doctrine aſſerted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Text will ſerve to that end or not: and that it need not be judged altogether impertinent to our purpoſe (notwithſtanding that which he hath ſaid) may be gathered in part from that which was ſaid (but now) upon the word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> upon which he had plaid the ſame Critick. Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi> (who could ſee as far as an ordinary man, into a Text of Scripture, whether they may compare with Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> or not) They, I ſay, count it no abſurdity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it of Hell, for that place of Torture is as fit (by a common

figure) to denote the place of Torment for the ungodly,<note place="margin">Vid. Synopſ. Crit. in Eſay 30</note> as Paradiſe, the place of Pleaſure, was to ſignifie the place appointed for the Saints happy Manſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Worm that never dyeth.</note>As Logicians ſay of an Abſurdity, that one being granted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand will follow it: So Mr. <hi>R.</hi> being ſo vain as to diſcourſe as he hath done upon other particulars, was not afraid to ſhew himſelf ſo abſurd, as to give a ſuitable gloſs upon theſe words of our Saviour — <hi>where their Worm never dieth,</hi> telling us that this is in this preſent life; he means, only in this life, if he mean any thing to his purpoſe: And to make it good he citeth <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44.<note place="margin">Mark 9.43, 44. p. 32.</note> (miſprinted, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.) and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> 14.10, 11. wherein he hath ſhewed himſelf very impartial, for he hath not ſpared himſelf and his Cauſe. There being hardly any Scriptures more apparently deſtructive of it than thoſe: the latter I have mentioned before, the former I ſhall now inſiſt on. The words are theſe.<note place="margin">Mark 9.44. <hi>opened.</hi> p. 32.</note>—<hi>to go into hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched, where (viz.</hi> in which Hell) <hi>their Worm</hi> (ſpeaking of the wicked) <hi>never dyeth,</hi> this is only in this life ſaith Mr. <hi>R.</hi>—ſtrange certainly! for our Lord tells us, 'tis in Hell. And I hope Mr. <hi>R.</hi> himſelf will not be ſo bold as to interpret Hell in this Text of the Grave. For there is no Worm in the Grave, but ſuch as dyeth in a little time. And this is ſo remarkable that it is ſet down three times within ſix Verſes, and therefore ſeems to note ſomething more than a Puniſhment in this life only. If he take it to be meant properly, of a real and natural Worm, 'tis a ſign he hath a Worm in his own Pate; if he take it figuratively, of the Worm of Conſcience, or the furious Reflections thereof upon its own wilful wickedneſs, and its fierce Accuſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood) then he may not deny it to be after this preſent life is ended. Thoſe Accuſations and Terrors of Conſcience that <hi>Judas</hi> found in himſelf, a little before he hang'd himſelf, were doubtleſs continued in his Soul after its ſeparation from the body; and my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cannot handſomly deny it, unleſs he have entertained the ſottiſh Dream of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That the Soul is aſleep after the death of the Body. And thus I have ſpoken to all that is in any tolerable ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the former part of his Book to the 32 page of it.</p>
                  <p>In that page he deals with another Text of Scripture, but ſeeing it is ſuch as I would not urge to prove Everlaſting Puniſhments by, and ſeeing his Diſcourſe upon it is (in a great part) wild and extravagant, I ſhall not trouble my ſelf or my Reader with it, but rather proceed to the 36 page, where he hath ſomething fit to be examined, as of <hi>the Burning the Tares,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. of the word <hi>Curſed, &amp;c.</hi> which will be the Subject (in part) of the next Paragraph.</p>

                  <p>BUT what will not thoſe men venture to ſay, that are reſolved to maintain a bad Cauſe by the ſtrength of their own ungodly wits? [<hi>The Wicked ſhall be conſumed with the Earth it ſelf,</hi> and by this it appears, ſaith he.] No ſuch matter ſay I; this is falſe in it ſelf, and therefore cannot appear to be true by that Text in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> That it is falſe in it ſelf, I need name no more than that formerly inſiſted on, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible.</hi>

The former runs thus. (<hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) As the Tares are gathered and burned in the Fire, ſo ſhall it be (with the wicked) in the end of this world.

The Tares are burned ſo as to remain no longer Tares. But ſo ſhall it be at the end of the world in reſpect of the wicked. And if he would reaſon ſo, there is little reaſon we ſhould much regard it. They ſhall be burned (as the Tares) <hi>viz.</hi> as they ſhall, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>i. e.</hi> certainly, irreſiſtibly, as worthleſs things and the like.

which it hath upon the Tares, 'tis manifeſt it ſhall pain them and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, make them weep and gnaſh their teeth for vexation, but ſurely it ſhall not make the Tares do ſo.<note place="margin">Eſay 42.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord is as a man of War,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, ſhall I therefore apply Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Logick, to that ſaying, and infer (in ſpight of Religion and good ſenſe) that the Lord is not in many places at once, becauſe a man of War is not, or that the Lord is mortal, becauſe a man of War is ſo?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If the Fire of Hell be Corporal Fire, yet nothing proves that it muſt needs conſume them that are caſt into it. For it is not to be conſidered, what it might do in an ordinary and a natural way, but what the God of all Power will have it to do, and hath appointed it to do. The reaſon why that Fire that fell upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> did conſume them, was not ſo much becauſe it was Corporal Fire, as becauſe God had appointed it to conſume them.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.41. &amp; 46.</note> But how can my <hi>Author</hi> prove that the Fire of Hell is appointed to conſume the wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?

They that ſhall be ſent away with a Curſe into Everlaſting Fire, ſhall be ſo far from being conſumed, that they ſhall be in <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> Verſ. the laſt.

which cannot be when they are conſumed, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> himſelf being Judge. And if the wicked ſhould be caſt into Hell-fire, only to be conſumed by it; then I ſay, the caſe would be no worſe with them, in reſpect of the Fire of Hell, than the caſe of Malefactors, in reſpect of the Faggot-fire, here on Earth; yea no worſe than the caſe of faithful Martyrs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for they were conſumed by Fire, (as to their Bodies.)

I am apt to think that the word Fire doth not there ſignifie any Corporal Fire, or Fire properly ſo called; becauſe I believe Spirits not to be any ſutable objects for real Fire to work upon; much leſs can I think that Corporal Fire can be the chiefeſt means of their Puniſhment, as this Everlaſting Fire is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to be, ſince there is no mention made of any worſe thing prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54321:27"/>
for them. This Fire therefore I would rather underſtand of the fire of God's vengeance, and the immediate impreſſions of his wrath: And ſo 'tis no abſurdity to expreſs the wrath of God by fire; for its terrible and piercing Nature may fitly repreſent it to us in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which cannot be conceived by us to the full, for <hi>who knows the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Anger,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmist:</hi> yea, and God himſelf alſo,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. <hi>v.</hi> laſt.</note> as he is a Revenger upon his Enemies, is called a <hi>conſuming Fire,</hi> in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. This my <hi>Author</hi> hath took notice of, <hi>p.</hi> 44. — Others ſay,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> That the Fire of Hell is Metaphorical, ſo St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſome Modern Preachers.— And I think their judgment concerning it was as much worth as His. And though he is angry with them for it, yet he had more wit in his anger, than to undertake to diſprove them in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I ſhall not need therefore to ſay any thing more for it, unleſs he had been pleaſed to ſay ſomething againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am not of their mind, who make it wholly and only figurative. I ſee no reaſon at all to the contrary,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Partly Real. or Corporal.</note> but that we may ſuppoſe the Fire that ſhall torment the Bodies of the wicked to be real and corporal fire, as ours is, I mean as real, though perhaps not of the ſame kind. And this Opinion a Man may eaſily be led unto, by reading thoſe Scriptures which ſo often and ſo plainly call it fire; <hi>a Lake of Fire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.42. Mark 9.44. <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, a Furnace of Fire, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquenchable Fire,</hi> and ſuch like, which ſeem to intimate real fire. And that real fire may be ſufficient to puniſh the Bodies of the wicked by, (in caſe the terrible God ſhall be pleaſed to uſe it for that end) cannot be doubted.</p>
                  <p>And if it ſhould be but figurative fire, it would be no comfort to the wicked that ſhall be in it; for thoſe things in Scripture, that are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſet forth, by real and corporal things, (to help our weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions) are ſuch as do exceed thoſe things, in their reſpective natures, whether for terror, or for comfort. God, who is called a ſhield, is a greater ſecurity to his Servants than a Shield: And as he is called a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire,</hi> ſo he is more terrible to his Enemies than Fire, (in the day that he ſhall deal with them.) So that if Hell-fire be not fire indeed, but ſomething elſe figuratively expreſſed by it, 'tis certainly ſomething worſe than fire.</p>

                  <q>

Muſt Hell be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, if the Earth be? ſurely not.</p>
                  <p>But if it be below, (in, or under the Earth) What ſhall become of it, after the Earth is deſtroyed? What place can be for it, when its place is burnt up? — Alas vain Man! wilt thou make difficulties to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? What!

O how ſilly is ſuch a ſurmiſal! If the whole Earth were deſtroyed, a word of his Mouth could make all that ſpace wherein it ſtood, a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hell for his Enemies.

<q>

To Deſtroy therefore in that place, is to puniſh. And to puniſh in Hell is manifeſtly ſpoken as an aggravation of that Puniſhment (or deſtruction) Hell cannot mean the Grave in that place. For the Soul is not deſtroyed (in any ſenſe) in the Grave; what then can it mean but a place of Torment ſo called (the Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> is no receptacle for Souls) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gehenna,</hi> or Hell in that Text doth not mean that very place, but only, as was ſaid, alludes to it.</p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Leigh—The Conſciences of men are many times afraid of a Puniſhment after this life. Therefore there is ſuch a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be feared.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> R. <hi>Replies—p. 55.</hi> That's no proof of it, for mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are as they are inſtructed, according to the Proverb, Such as the Doctor, ſuch the Scholar. And hence it is that the Conſcience of a Papiſt tells him 'tis a ſin to eat meat on Friday. Yet that's no proof of its being ſo.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Conſcience a proof of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment after this Life.</note>I anſwer as follows. The Compariſon he uſeth about the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not argue any thing, but only illuſtrate that which he ſpake before; the inſtance of which, if I miſtake not, is thus: That mens Conſciences tell them there is a Puniſhment for the wicked after this life, meerly becauſe they are ſo inſtructed (<hi>viz.</hi> by thoſe unskilful Preachers whom they had the unhappineſs to hear) ſo that the only reaſon why they fear ſuch a Puniſhment, is becauſe of the Inſtructions they have had about it.<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> Evidence.</note> Now this I deny. It is not meerly from the Inſtructions of others, that men apprehend and fear a Puniſhment after Death. For the Heathens of old, who were far from being inſtructed by our Preachers, had ſtrange and powerful thoughts of a Puniſhment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54321:30"/>
for bad men after death, Witneſs their Expreſſions about <hi>Siſyphus, Tantalus, Rhadamanthus,</hi> and the <hi>Stygian Lake,</hi> ſeveral paſſages in <hi>Virgils Æneids, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how many might we hear of that in the days of their health and ſtrength were as confident as could be, and feared no ſin that they liked of, that were alſo groſly ignorant, and cared for no Inſtructions unleſs it were how to get money, and enrich their Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that yet have been in great fear when a dangerous ſickneſs ſeized upon them, O they ſhall dye, they ſhall die, and what ſhall become of them then— And how ſhould they have ſuch Impreſſions upon their Spirits, if they had not a ſenſe of this Truth, as ignorant as they are.<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> — And what if the Inſtructions they had about it be a means of the Terror upon their Conſciences, this rather confirms the point than confutes it: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the thoughts of an Everlaſting ſtate of Puniſhment hereafter, is ſo powerful upon them, and ſo terrible to them that they can neither eat nor drink, nor ſleep, nor take any comfort in wealth and friends, in Wine or Muſick, or any of thoſe things they naturally moſt delight in: Yea, fills their mouths with horrid cryes and groans, and hath put them into ſuch violent ſhakings, as hath ſhook the Beds, yea, the Chambers they lay in. Read the memorable Hiſtory of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> and others, and you will ſee what Agonies and Terrors, the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Everlaſting miſeries hath cauſed in them.</p>
                  <p>Now hence I would offer Mr. <hi>R.</hi> this <hi>Dilemma</hi> to deal with—
<q>Either theſe unſpeakable Terrors were natural works of Conſcience,<note place="margin">The Authors Argument.</note> (as awakened by its God and Judge) or elſe they were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Inſtructions they formerly had about this matter.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he ſay the former, then he doth as good as grant what I contend for, for that's the only reaſon of his denial of the proof, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth not act ſo, of it ſelf, but by vertue of ſome former teachings. And whether he grant it or no, it muſt needs be a proof of it, for the natural workings of Conſcience are from God, and therefore ſuppoſe the certainty of their objects in their reſpective kinds. As becauſe it is natural to the Conſcience to urge a man to pay what he owes (while he is able) thence it follows unavoidably, that it is a real duty ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>If he ſay the latter [that theſe extreameſt terrors are occaſioned by thoſe Inſtructions about a future Everlaſting puniſhment] then he is caſt alſo. For what (can he think) makes thoſe Inſtructions ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54321:31"/>
powerful upon him? they have not naturally ſuch effects, for many hear them often and regard them not. And if it be from a ſupernatural power, it muſt be Gods work or the Devils: not the Devils, for he would rather make men forget and ſlight ſuch Inſtructions, leſt they ſhould be frighted out of his ſlavery. If from God, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there is ſuch a ſtate, for God would not deceive them.</p>

Therefore there is ſuch a Puniſhment— Mr. <hi>R.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in theſe words. [1. Why did you not ſay and prove that they held they ſhould be in Torments without end? The Heathens do not believe any ſuch Puniſhment after this Life,<note place="margin">p. 56-59.</note> for they deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body.] And then he goes on after his own way from the 56 to 59 page, telling us a ſtory of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Philoſopher (for ſo he calls him, as though there had been a <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Divine, from whom to be diſtinguiſhed) and alſo of <hi>Plato</hi> and his Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not fit for my paper to be filled with; and therefore I leave them,<note place="margin">p. 58.</note> as more proper for his own Pamphlet, and for the Book that he ſo gravely mentioneth, I mean Mr. <hi>Jeſſe</hi> his Almanack. (And if Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> had ſpent that time in making Almanacks, which he ſpent in compoſing this precious piece, it might have been more for his comfort, or at leaſt, leſs for his ſorrow, when he comes to dye.)</p>
                  <p>But to come to the point; [why did not Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſay and prove that the Heathens believed a Puniſhment for bad men, never to end?] Since I have undertaken this Task, I muſt ſuppoſe my ſelf obliged to make Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſome Anſwer in the caſe, and it is thus in ſhort.</p>
                  <p>It was (in all probability) becauſe he thought there was no need of ſaying it or proving it: nevertheleſs if it may be any Satisfaction to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> or his Proſelytes, I ſhall be content to ſay it and prove it too.

                     <label>The Reply.</label> This Anſwer is large enough, but whether it be good enough, is now to be enquired. For the firſt part, the charge of Boldneſs upon that learned perſon (if he had been guilty of overmuch) might be brought againſt him more honeſtly by (almoſt) any man, than my <hi>Author;</hi> for who ever was ſo bold as he, to write ſo much in defence of that Opinion which hath always been abhorred by Orthodox Divines? To his firſt queſtion,<note place="margin">Reply to the firſt part of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Of Gods Juſtice.</note> I return this Anſwer, that though the Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon the Impenitent be juſt Puniſhments, yet Divine Juſtice will not be ſatisfied by their Temporal Puniſhment, ſince his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thinks it fit to continue their being Everlaſtingly, and to raiſe them to an incorruptible ſtate, and ſince he hath reſolved not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Impenitent (for if they ſhould enjoy that Bleſſing, they ſhould not be ſent away with a Curſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41.) I ſay theſe things conſidered, His juſtice will engage him to Puniſh them for ever, for they will be ever worthy of Puniſhment, their Iniquity will always deſerve ſuch wages, and it is the part of juſtice to pay it to them (ſuppoſing no compenſation to be pleadable by them, as none ſhall be) The other particulars of his Anſwer (herein) will receive very eaſie and quick diſpatch.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54321:32"/>
to prove that the wicked ſhall have an end,<note place="margin">His Sophiſtry.</note> and therefore not ſuffer endleſs Puniſhment; I ſay therein he proves himſelf a profound So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter, or rather, a moſt ridiculous one: for the Text runs thus, <hi>Then I went into the Sanctuary of God,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and ſo I underſtood the end of theſe men.</hi> (Speaking of the wicked that proſper'd in the world.) Their end in this place no man (I verily believe) did ever interpret, as he, of their coming to an end (as we call it) or of the ending of their Beings, as the Birds, and Beaſts, and Plants ſhall have an end: and I ſhall not now trouble my ſelf to confute ſo wild a conceit, ſince I have ſaid enough to it upon the word <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> in the third Section of the firſt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>By their End therefore I underſtand rather their Lot and Reward, their final Portion and laſt Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> that it will be Miſerable, as on the contrary, the good mans End is Comfortable. Behold the upright, for the <hi>[End]</hi> of that man is Peace. That is, his portion at laſt is Peace, his laſt Eſtate is full of Peace and bleſſed Satisfaction in his God, whatever his former ſtate in this preſent world hath been.</p>
                  <p>His Aſſertion following deſerves as little to be ſaid to it, namely, <hi>[That God is pleaſed to ſave of the worſt of ſinners]</hi> for if he mean it of ſinners againſt the Law, I confeſs it is true, God is pleaſed to ſave ſome of thoſe that have been the groſſeſt Tranſgreſſors of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as Idolaters, Adulterers and the like.<note place="margin">The worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have been ſaved in what ſenſe a Truth.</note> But if he mean it of the worſt ſinners againſt the Goſpel, as thoſe that live and dye in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and unbelief, and finally refuſe to give up themſelves to Chriſt as Saviour and Lord, then I ſay, I deny it, and let him prove it if he can (And he might eaſily know that 'tis theſe that we affirm to be the objects of Everlaſting Vengeance, and not the groſſeſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Moral Law that turn unfeignedly from their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and believe in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Nor do we ſay (as he would ſeem to intimate) that thoſe wicked ones that proſpered more than others, ſhall be puniſhed Everlaſtingly for their proſperity, but for their wickedneſs, and their impenitency in it. And if he think it is unjuſt that they ſhould ſuffer for ever upon that account, he had beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what I have ſaid upon that Point in the latter pages of the firſt Chap. Sect. 3. And as for <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. which he would fain get on his ſide, it maketh nothing at all for him; for the perſon <hi>Solomon</hi> bids, <hi>rejoyce in the day of Proſperity,</hi> muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be a godly man; for as for the wicked (whether he proſper or not) the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>We unto him, Eſay</hi> 3.11.</p>

I ſhall now urge one or two Arguments in the caſe.</p>
                  <p>If men had corrupted the Scriptures (and made them ſpeak in any points of Divinity otherwiſe than at firſt) it muſt be ſuppoſed to have been done before the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, or after. If before, ſurely Chriſt who taxed many other errors in the <hi>Jews</hi> would not have ſuffered ſuch a wickedneſs to paſs without Reprehenſion. (And 'tis not unknown how careful the <hi>Jews</hi> were in keeping the Oracles of God committed to them.) And that they were not corrupted ſince the Death of Chriſt is clear, for Copies being diſperſed in the world more and more (one age after another) how could ſuch a thing be acted by ſome, but others would ſoon diſcover it? And it may not be doubted but God's Providence did watch ſomewhat extraordinarily, as to this matter which ſo much concerned his own glory, and the good of his people to the worlds end. Surely he that ſo often diſcovers thoſe that have corrupted the Coin of Princes and States, would not conceal thoſe long that ſhould attempt to corrupt and pervert his Sacred Laws. And here I ſhall borrow an excellent paſſage of the worthy Mr. <hi>R. Baxter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Saints Reſt.</hi> part. 2. cap 4. Sect. 6.</note> in the laſt page of the cited Section, which may ſhame all the wittieſt men of Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Religion, as to the point.</p>
                  <p>If any man (ſaith he) be ſo blind as to think it uncertain whether theſe be the ſame Books which the Apoſtles wrote; I would ask him by what aſſurance he holds his Lands? 1. How doth he know that his Deeds, Conveyances and Leaſes be not counterfeit writings? or that they are the ſame that their Fore-fathers made? Surely they have nothing but mens words for it, and yet they verily think their Lands are their own. 2. And whereas they hold all by the Law of the Land,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54321:35"/>
how know they that theſe Laws are not Counterfeit? and that they are the ſame Laws that were made by ſuch and ſuch Kings and Parliaments long ago? They have nothing but mens words for all this. And yet if this be uncertain, then any man may be turned out of all he hath, as if he had no certain Tenure. And is it not certain that thoſe Laws that are kept and practiſed throughout the Land, cannot poſſibly be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, but it would have been publickly known? And yet a word in a Statute Book may be falſe Printed. And much more certain is it, that the Scriptures cannot be counterfeited, becauſe it is not in one Kingdom only, but in all the world (almoſt) that they have been uſed, and the Copies diſperſed; and Miniſters ſtill in Office to preach them and publiſh them. So that they could not be generally and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely corrupted, except all the world ſhould have met and conſented together for that end, which could not be done in ſecret, but all muſt know of it. And yet many Bibles may be here and there miſprinted, but then there would be Copies enough to Correct them by. So that if it be uncertain whether theſe be (for ſubſtance and in the main) the ſame Books that the Apoſtles writ, then nothing in the world can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to us but what we ſee; and why we may not as wiſely queſtion our Eye-ſight I do not well know. So far that Learned perſon.</p>
                  <p>And after all this,<note place="margin">The Author's Proofs.</note> I ſhall add ſomething more to this ſame end (for it is hard to ſpeak too much in ſuch a caſe) farther to confirm the Faith of the weak Chriſtian againſt the attempts of this mighty Shaker (who I think hath out gone moſt of the Shakers that have went before him. <hi>Gregory Martyn,</hi> that grave profound Popeling in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, did practiſe this Art with the greateſt care and skill he had, and diſcovered (if he did not lye) a great many groſs corruptions in our Engliſh Tranſlation, to the advantage of our Hereſies (as he calls it) But ſince the Learned Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That Books of another nature are ſeldom queſtioned after this manner; when did you hear any man making any doubt whether the Books of <hi>Plato,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle, Hippocrates,</hi> and of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Galen, Plutarch,</hi> of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> and <hi>Florus, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> were the writings of thoſe men whoſe names they bear, or whether they are agreeable to thoſe Copies which they wrote at firſt?</p>
                  <p>So that the Writings of Philoſophers and Poets, Phyſicians, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Naturaliſts, Moraliſts, (though very ancient) ſhall paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly for theirs, whoſe names they go under, and are not imagined to be corrupted, or altered from what they were at firſt (Mr. <hi>R.</hi> doth not inſinuate any doubt in that caſe.) But when it comes to that which concerns our precious Souls, that word which contains our rules in Life, our comforts at death, and our foundations of hope, as to a better world hereafter, O then his patient heart is moved, his Doubts, and Fears, and Suſpicions are ſuggeſted: he kicks and flings and lays about him extreamly; he throws his blackeſt duſt in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we may have no eyes to ſee, nor no reaſon to apprehend, that thoſe Copies of the Bible which we have among us are the ſame (in ſenſe and ſubſtance) with them that the Pen-men of Scripture wrote. And all becauſe we have not thoſe Original Copies to ſhew, (as we have not of the other, for he cannot ſhew us any of <hi>Plato</hi>'s, &amp;c. hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing) Is it not manifeſtly the work of the Devil to caſt doubts in mens minds about the one, while he raiſeth no doubts about the other? It ſeems he can be content to have us believe that other Books are what they pretend to be, but he is not ſo willing that we ſhould believe the ſame of God's Book: and no wonder, for he knoweth the belief of that will be more likely to do us good than the belief of the other.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>2</label> 2. If the Scripture were corrupted in the Originals, it muſt be by ſuch as believed it to be the word of God, or ſuch as did not: If he ſay, by them that believed it ſo to be, then I would fain know how
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54321:36"/>
thoſe that had ſo much Religion as to believe it, ſhould at the ſame time have ſo much profaneneſs as to go about to corrupt the Copies of it? Would not the heart of the wickedeſt man fail him, when he was about ſuch a horrid deſign, if he had but the leaſt thought that it was the Word of his Maker that he ſet himſelf to corrupt? If he ſay it was corrupted by thoſe that did not believe it to be the Word of God, but looked upon it as a piece of deceit, and a politick innovation to keep fools in awe; then why ſhould they trouble themſelves to corrupt it? doubtleſs they would think it were corrupt enough already, and would not much envy the holy Chriſtians any of thoſe delights and comforts which they had in it, or from it. And if they ſhould ever have undertaken ſuch a work (it being that which would require much time and pains to do it, to any purpoſe) it muſt be ſuppoſed that they muſt have had ſome conſiderable motives, from credit or profit, of which no rational account (I dare ſay) can ever be given. Nor can it be proved that ever any ſuch thing was deſigned by the enemies of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate Emperor (<hi>Acerrimus ille Chriſti hoſtis,</hi> as an excellent Author ſtyles him<note n="*" place="margin">Zanchius in Tom. <hi>8.</hi> Orat. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>) He I ſay is well known to have been as fit a man to manage ſuch a work as moſt ever was in the world, for he had wit and learning in abundance, he had alſo great power without him, and an impenitent hardned heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and employed all his power and policy to the ruine, not only of Chriſtians, but Chriſtianity: and accordingly he proceeded in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, by Baniſhments and Impriſonments, fire and Sword, and by pulling down Churches and by putting down all Schools of Learning, (the two latter of which, ſome that go for Chriſtians among us could have wiſhed him good ſucceſs in) yet I have not found that ever he did any ſuch thing as this we are ſpeaking of, or that he employed any others about it [to corrupt the Copies of Scripture that were in the hands of Chriſtians, or to counterfeit it, by any other writing:] He was crafty enough to take other courſes againſt Chriſtianity that were eaſier to be followed.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſuch thing were done, how ſoon would it be diſcovered? If a Proteſtant ſhould Print ſome Maſs-Books with ſome conſiderable alterations, leaving out a prayer to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and putting in a Prayer to Chriſt inſtead of it, how quickly would the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> eſpy the change, how ſoon would the <hi>Bulls</hi> roar from <hi>Babylon</hi>

or Catholick, or allowed under the Hands of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Holineſs.— And do ye think, that the Chriſtians in the Primitive times were not as zealous for the Scriptures, as the <hi>Papiſt's</hi> are for the Maſs-Books, or that they would not have been as careful to diſcover ſuch forgeries, in or about them, if any ſuch things had been?</p>

If the Scripture were counterfeited, or the Original Copies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any, it muſt be by blockiſh and ignorant Perſons, or by Men of conſiderable Wit and Learning. The former would not undertake ſuch a work, or if they ſhould, they could not manage it and carry it on. Nor (may we well imagine) the latter; for certainly Men of wit in any tolerable ſenſe, could not but apprehend the difficulty of ſuch a work (the Copies being diſperſed among Chriſtians, that valued them more than all the wealth of the World, and would be as careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from ſuch corruptions) I ſay ſuch muſt needs apprehend the great difficulty of the work, and the horrible ſhame and reproach that they ſhould bring upon themſelves, if they ſhould fail in it, or have their wicked deſign diſcovered: (and what great gain they might get by it, to countervail ſo great a ſhame, or to encourage them in the danger of it, cannot eaſily be conceived.)</p>

They read thoſe Copies which the Orthodox uſed, and oppoſed them therewith; which the Papiſts conſidering, did give out confidently (though blaſphemouſly) that the Reading of Scriptures among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellar.</hi> de verbo Dei.</note> was the way to make them Hereticks; (ſo that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of them ſo to do, they would have us think did proceed from Religiouſneſs, and not wickedneſs; this profaneneſs they acted, not for the Devil's, but for God's ſake) And why ſhould Hereticks ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pervert the Copies of Scripture, whiles they hoped to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Hereſies by thoſe Copies, and through their falſe Philoſophy and vain deceit to turn the Texts thereof in defence of them? However, 'tis ſure my <hi>Author</hi> cannot ſerve his turn hereby, for what if he could
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54321:37"/>
prove that they endeavoured to corrupt ſome Texts, (about myſterious points) yet there is not ſo much as a ſhew of reaſon why we ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the places which ſpeak of a Hell, and everlaſting Puniſhment for the wicked, to have been added to the Text by their hands (that had been but a bad courſe, yea a mad courſe to get the favour and applauſes of the World, which yet was the great thing they aimed at.)</p>
                  <p>And that leud and diſorderly Perſons did not corrupt the Copies of Scripture in favour of their looſe and wicked practices is plain;<note place="margin">Nor by looſe Livers.</note> for if ſo, they would have blotted out thoſe ſtrict precepts of holineſs and obedience that it is filled with and eſpecially the Doctrines of God's wrath againſt ſin, and everlaſting puniſhments for them that follow it: which they have not done, for we ſee they remain in our Bibles, and ſhall remain ſtill in ſpight of Mr. <hi>R.</hi>'s diſpleaſure.</p>

Church-Hiſtories give us vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examples of God's Judgments upon the Enemies of it, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Emperors, and eſpecially <hi>Julian,</hi> and the Hereticks that abuſed it, to maintain their falſe Doctrines. <hi>Sabinian</hi> having wrote a Book againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity, his Head ſuddenly fell off from his Shoulders, no Man knew how; and the like (or as ſtrange judgments) upon others of them, you may find related by Dr. <hi>Beard,</hi>

deep wiſdom and goodneſs; To whom he replied, That they durſt not ſo to do, becauſe they looked upon it as Divine; and that God had ſhewed his diſpleaſure upon thoſe that went about to mingle it with their own Writings; where he mentions one <hi>Theodectes,</hi> a Poet, who purpoſing to put ſome part of it in his own Poems, was ſtricken with blindneſs, and recovered not his ſight till he had changed his purpoſe. And the like he relates of another, in the foregoing words, which for brevity ſake I omit.

Surely if he can think all thoſe to be but fooliſh Men, or fooliſh Expoſitors, that have expounded the word <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>Gehenna,</hi> for a place of puniſhment after this life, (ſuch as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Paraeus, Muſculus, Perkins Willet,</hi> and Multitudes more of eminent Proteſtants) he will ſhew himſelf fit enough to ſail to <hi>Anticyrus,</hi> or to be cut for the <hi>Simples</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi> Well, had theſe Men been able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the ſeverity of his cenſure, they might eaſily have prevented it, namely by expounding <hi>Hell</hi> for no worſe place than a Grave, in all the New Teſtament; Everlaſting, for a few Minutes time, and Puniſhment for Annihilation: that is, a Puniſhment inflicted, for a puniſhment that cannot be felt: (for when a Man is turned into nothing, he cannot be ſenſible of any thing.)

                  <p>The laſt Pillar of Hell torments (which he is pleaſed to mention) is a perſwaſion,<note place="margin">The laſt Pillar of Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> that the believing it is a means to make men leave their ſins, and the not believing it, a means of Licentiouſneſs. — Whether this may be called a Pillar of it or not, I ſhall not enquire; the thing I affirm to be a certain truth (whatever he ſay againſt it) for it could not be that men ſhould follow any way of wickedneſs ſecurely and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they believed it did tend to ſo ſad an end. If they did throughly and ſtedfaſtly believe the everlaſting Puniſhments in another world, they would not run the hazard of them for all the pleaſures and profits of this world, nor think the greateſt ſpiritual care and pains too great (in a way of Religion) to make ſure of eſcaping it. And that the Terror of the Lord (in the knowledge of it) tends to perſwade men (to leave their ſins) is clearly intimated by the manifold threats of wrath and puniſhment againſt the children of diſobedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18. Coloſ. 3.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> for what do thoſe threatnings ſerve for, if not to deter men from ſin? And if any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will tend that way, ſurely everlaſting puniſhment much more. And on the other ſide, that wicked men would be more bold to ſin, if they were fully perſwaded that there ſhall be no everlaſting puniſhment after this life (and ſay as the Epicure, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we dye</hi>) is ſo plain that I ſhall not write one line to prove it, yet nevertheleſs I ſhall conſider what he hath ſaid to diſprove it. And firſt (to paſs over his extravagancies from the 92. page to 102. about the Decree of God as relating to mans fall, and the like points which are thruſt in perforce, by the head and ſhoulders,<note place="margin">His Arguments to prove the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Hell no preſervation from ſin.</note> and have no more to do with the point in hand, than the Lines of his Book with the Beams of the Sun; I ſay paſſing theſe) I ſhall come directly to his Reaſons, in the 103. page, thus.</p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>R.</hi>—That the belief of Hell torments is no ſuch preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from ſin, is evident; for the greateſt ſinners believe there is ſuch and yet ſin ſtill.</q>
                  <p>But what doth he mean by [ſuch a preſervative from ſin] and by [believing them.] If he mean in the former, a total and compleat preſervative, ſuch as keeps them from all ſin,<note place="margin">Examined.</note> I confeſs it is not ſuch a preſervative: or if he mean it of ſuch as preſerves them from the common practice of groſs ſins, I grant it alſo. But yet the belief of Hell is a preſervative from ſin in ſome meaſure, and keeps wicked men (ſo far as it is believed by them) from ſinning with ſo much greedineſs, ſecurity and peace as otherwiſe they would. As the Laws of the Land
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54321:40"/>
againſt Robberies and Murders, do keep men from committing ſuch crimes ſo often and ſo ſecurely, as otherwiſe they would do, though they do not wholly reſtrain them from thoſe crimes. And now let us examine his Reaſon or proof, <hi>viz. Becauſe the greateſt ſinners do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a Hell, and yet ſin ſtill as much as ever;</hi> This ſaith he, maketh it evident, <hi>that the belief of Hell is no ſuch preſervative againſt ſin.</hi> But this proof proves nothing, nor would he himſelf like of it in another caſe: for (if he be not an Atheiſt) he will eaſily grant, that the belief of a God doth really tend to cleanſe mens hearts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives: yet there is not any groſſer wickedneſs in the world than thoſe that are committed by ſome who profeſs to believe there is a God, and do believe it after a ſort (and would abhor that man that ſhould ſay there is none) He adds for confirmation as follows — R. <hi>for though they be never ſo wicked, yet they hope the Torments of Hell, which they believe do not belong to them, or that they may repent before they dye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo may I ſay of the other. For though men believe there is a God, yet they (too often) hope that he ſees them not, or that he is not much offended with their wickedneſs, or the like. And yet I will not doubt but the belief of a God tends in it ſelf, to do ſome good upon men, (nor doth my <hi>Author</hi> himſelf imagine that an Atheiſtical opinion is a friend to Religion, but an enemy it.)</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, what doth he mean by a Belief of Hell torments? If he mean it of a ſlight belief, a fleeting opinion that they are real, while they know little reaſon why they ſhould believe them, but only becauſe others are of that judgment; This I confeſs is no great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from ſin, but a grounded and fixed belief of them is aſſuredly a great preſervative from it as was ſeen before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">P. 103.</note>The following lines contain no great matter, but only a ſtory of a drunken <hi>Arminian,</hi> that ſaid he was at preſent in a ſtate of Damnation, but to morrow (when ſober) ſhould return into a ſtate of grace. And why might he not have told us as well of <hi>John a Leydon</hi>'s many Marriages, or <hi>Knipperdoling</hi>'s Breathing upon the people when he bad them receive the Holy Ghoſt. And what if the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſpoke ſo ſottiſhly when he was drunk, or were of the ſame principles when he was ſober, yet he never was ſo blind when drunk, or ſo bold when ſober, as to deny there is a Hell, and to compare the terrors and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof with the flames of Purgatory, and the Chimerical Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beggars that women ſometimes fright little children with, as he hath done, in page 88. and 90. of his admired Book.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54321:40"/>
                  <p>Secondly, he proceeds after this manner.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>R.</hi> — If fear of Hell were a preſerver againſt ſin,<note place="margin">His ſecond Reaſon. <hi>p. 104.</hi>
                     </note> then thoſe that are delivered from that fear (and believe they ſhall be ſaved) would ſin more than others, which is not ſo.</q>
                  <p>Very true, if they have nothing more or better to preſerve them from ſinful courſes; but if they have the love of God and holineſs in their hearts, they will ſhun the ways of ſin, though freed from the fears of Hell. In a word, though the godly would eſchew evil when he is freed from the fears of Hell, yet the wicked man would follow it the more if he were ſo. And I doubt not but many ſuch have been more bold to do wickedly ſince his Book againſt Hell came into the world, than ever they were before.</p>
                  <p>In the 105. page,<note place="margin">p. 105.</note> He hath nothing that is worth a large conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet that which may ſeem any thing pertinent ſhall not be omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the luſts of men are ſtronger than the fears of Hell.] No wonder if they be ſo in this Age, wherein ſuch a skilful workman as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> hath uſed all his craft to make them believe there is no Hell. But if men's belief of it were ſtronger, the fear of it would prevail againſt their ſtrongeſt ſinful luſts, ſo as that they would not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to follow and fulfil them in their ordinary courſe.</p>
                  <p>In the 106. page, He hath ſeveral Texts of Scripture, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11.<note place="margin">p. 106.</note> 
                     <hi>Malachi</hi> 2.2. and others, which tend not ſo much as in ſhew to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that which he had undertaken to prove. But poſſibly he might ſuppoſe that ſome will think the better of his Book when they ſee ſo many Scriptures in one page, though they be not ſerviceable to his deſign. And having ſpoken ſomewhat Heatheniſhly before, he will now make his Reader amends in part with a Divine Axiome of his own in the 106. page line 3. [If ſinners could enjoy all the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, yet they will find that they have made a bad bargain of it.] Which I confeſs is a truth; but it will better appear to be ſo by my Doctrine, than by his. If they live and dye ungodly, and ſo come to everlaſting miſeries, they will ſee what a bad bargain it was to purchaſe thoſe miſeries with the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; but if they be turned into nothing at the day of Judgment (as he would have us think) Then (in that ſtate, if I might call it a ſtate) they could not be ſenſible of any of their follies, in chuſing the pleaſures of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pleaſures of piety. Doubtleſs too many in the world (yea too many that I know in the world) would think it no very hard bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54321:41"/>
but rather account it a happineſs in ſome degree, if they could but pleaſe themſelves (as they would) with their lyes and ſlanders,<note place="margin">The fruits of Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> their malice and profaneneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be aſſured at the ſame time, that they ſhould ſuffer no worſe puniſhment than to be turned into nothing. (after they had wrought all the miſchief they are able.) Would they not then be content (if the Laws of the Land would allow it) to hear a Sermon but once a year? and caſt off the very ſhew of Religion? Would they not be content to ſit round a Barrel (in the midſt of a Green) on the Lord's day in the Afternoons (yea in the Forenoons too) and deſire no better company than New Cards and Old Stories, all the day long? Would not a deſperate Damning Gallant be more welcome to them than a Preacher? and his ſhameleſs, Whoriſh, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Boaſtings be more pleaſing to their honeſt hearts, than the beſt Sermons of the other? Yea, would they not count him a uſeleſs creature, and think him unworthy ſo much as of the dregs of their Merry-go-down, for all the pains that he took to prevent their Damnation? For if it can do them no more hurt than to conſume them to nothing, they will not much value it, ſince that which makes an end of them, will alſo make an end of their Sorrows: and that it will do no worſe, they have this pamphlet to perſwade them; but let them not truſt to it, for its Author was not infallible: Mr. <hi>Samuel</hi> was no Prophet, nor Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardſon</hi> any of thoſe that wrote by the Spirit. And what he pretends for it from [the Deſtruction] of the wicked, hath received a cenſure in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">p. 107, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>In the 107. page, and thoſe that follow to the 113. page, he ſpeaks little or nothing that needs to be examined by me, for it tends not (ſo far as I can apprehend) to ſtrengthen his cauſe in general, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that particular point, which he hath laſt endeavoured to defend. And having no more to ſay to him as yet, I ſhall clear one truth, which tends to make my way the plainer when I ſhall meet with him again, <hi>viz.</hi> when I come to take a view of his conſiderations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the 113, 114. pages,<note place="margin">The endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Devils, proved.</note> and the reſt. The truth that I aſſert (in this caſe) is thus: That the fallen Angels ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting puniſhment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. We read of everlaſting fire prepared for them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall ſuffer everlaſtingly in it, for if they ſhould ſuffer in it but for a time, to what purpoſe (to ſpeak with Reverence) ſhould everlaſting fire be prepared for them? The word everlaſting, which hath hitherto been looked upon as one of the ſaddeſt properties of that fire, would ſignifie very little in point of Terror, if it did not ſuppoſe the everlaſtingneſs of their puniſhment, for whom it is prepared. As the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54321:41"/>
durableneſs of a Dungeon or Priſon will be matter of ſmall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that ſhall endure but a little while in it.</p>
                  <p>And their perpetuity under puniſhment may alſo be cleared from their perpetuity in ſinning (their everlaſting impenitency) The Devils are paſt all true repentance for their ſins, and therefore they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent are called the children of the Devil, <hi>ye are of your father the Devil,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to the obſtinate <hi>Jews</hi> of old.</p>
                  <p>And if the Devils will never truly repent of their ſins, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they never be releaſed out of puniſhment? (yet I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they ſhould be forgiven if they ſhould repent, for God hath not made any promiſe of Mercy to them upon any terms, nor hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided any Mediator for them.) To which I might add (as equally ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to my preſent purpoſe) thoſe places of Scripture, that tell us, that <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12.32.</note> And if it never be forgiven, they that commit it ſhall never come out of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment after the day of Wrath is come upon them.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen the certainty of the Devils everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which of it ſelf will cut aſunder the ſinews of ſeveral of Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Arguments as ſhall be ſeen in the next Section.</p>

                  <p>His ſecond Conſideration is no leſs vain than the former, as thus:
<q>—R. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Wiſeſt of men,<note place="margin">p. 114.</note> and yet in his writings he mentions no Hell, nor any everlaſting Puniſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he would have done if he had known of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> What doth he think of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 15.24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath.</hi> Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeak of Hell in that place, or can he perſwade us that it means no more than the grave, when experience ſhews that the beſt and wiſeſt do not ſcape that no more than the worſt: yet that Hell (there mentioned) is manifeſtly ſuppoſed to be ſuch as the wiſe <hi>(walking in the way of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)</hi> may certainly eſcape. 2. Chriſt was wiſer than <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.46.</note> and he hath told us of [everlaſting puniſhment] whether the other hath or not. 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks not (at leaſt not plainly) of the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, of the union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the perſon of Chriſt, or of the imputation of his Righteouſneſs to believers; yet Chriſtians have believed thoſe points, and I hope the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſhall never baffle us out of our Faith therein. In a word, though <hi>Solomon</hi> were the wiſeſt man, yet God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that all Truth ſhould be compriſed in the ſmall Books that he hath written.</p>
                  <p>In his Third Conſideration,<note place="margin">p. 115.</note> he tells us (out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors writings) of the ſeven thouſand years, in the world to come in which all Souls ſhall be bleſſed] If ſuch a piece of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> learning be pleaſing to ſuch a Rabbi as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> yet that's little reaſon why I or other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be in love with it; and I think it more worthy to be ſlighted than to be anſwered. And that which he concludes with [The <hi>Jews</hi> were great ſearchers of Scripture, and if everlaſting puniſhment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54321:43"/>
were to be found therein, they would have ſeen it.] This, I ſay, is as little to be regarded; for no wiſe Man ever thought that the <hi>Jews</hi> ever ſaw, or acknowledged all Scripture-truths, they had as many errors and weakneſſes as other Men.</p>

                     <hi>B.</hi> The ſubſtance of this Reaſoning is thus: [The Saints did not confeſs any Everlaſting Puniſhment to be deſerved by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer.</hi> Yes, they did implicitly confeſs ſo much; for, in the Text he mentions, in 9. <hi>Daniel, To us belongs confuſion of face,</hi> it is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to temporal confuſion, and therefore may fitly be extended to Eternal confuſion.<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.23.</note>

                  <p>And if it were as he would have it, the Argument would prove but little, for the Saints in Scripture did not expreſly confeſs, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be given over to the Devil's Tyranny, to be poſſeſſed, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and tormented by him, and yet Chriſtians will not doubt but their ſins deſerve ſo much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To the 2d. part.</note>And the other may be anſwered as eaſily; for though I ſhould grant, that the Saints in Scripture did not expreſly give thanks for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from endleſs puniſhment, yet that is far from proving, that there is no ſuch thing: for they did not give thanks in that manner for Heaven it ſelf, and their appointment to it, yet we are very ſure that there is a Heaven, and that they are appointed to it.—</p>

                  <p>For firſt, What neceſſity is there of expounding <hi>Job</hi> 18.14. of <hi>death?</hi> The Text doth not mention Death, and I know nothing in the Context, that will force us to interpret it thereof. The Learned<note n="*" place="margin">Interpretum pene dixerim, Coryphaeus. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti Doctiſſ. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in praef. ad vol. <hi>2.</hi> Synopſ.</note>

                  <p>Well, but my <hi>Author</hi> will not ſo eaſily yield to have it underſtood of any thing but Death, becauſe that is moſt for his deſign, wherefore let us ſee if (taken in that ſenſe) it will be any help to his cauſe; and I ſhall not fear to undertake the Negative. I will prove, I ſay, that it will not: For, the King of Terrors is but [moſt terrible] if we make the moſt of it that we can. Now Death may be ſaid to be moſt terrible, though there be a greater terror after Death; For [moſt terrible] is not neceſſarily the very uttermoſt terror that can be, but in general very terrible. As when the Thunder ſhook down the Houſes in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> upon the Heads of them that dwelt therein, it may lawfully be ſaid, that it was a moſt terrible Day to them, yet the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be more terrible than that,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note> wherein the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the <hi>Earth with the works therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> So when Men are ſaid to be moſt excellent Scholars or Souldiers, we mean only that they have very good skill in Armes and Arts, but not that they do exceed all others therein. And in a word, the Scripture-phraſe is Conſonant to this; for, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.28.</note> the Lord threatned to lay <hi>the Land moſt deſolate,</hi> yea he aſſured them of it, [I will lay it <hi>moſt deſolate</hi>] and yet it ſuffered not a greater deſolation than other Lands had ſuffered, and doubtleſs not ſo great, in all reſpects, as the Land of <hi>Sodom</hi> had done: So that [moſt deſolate] is in ſubſtance no more than very deſolate: And ſo underſtand the King of Terrors, or moſt terrible, of that which is very terrible, as Death may be, (and is to many) though there be a worſe thing after Death, to them that dye in their ſins.

Becauſe many ungodly men have had a continued ſtate of proſperity, and ſcarce ever felt any thing that they accounted a puniſhment (yea, nothing more common than for ſuch perſons to conclude their ſins are pardoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not find themſelves puniſhed for them) <hi>I was envious at the proſperity of the wicked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 1 <hi>to</hi> 6 verſe.</note> and in the following words he tells us, <hi>they are not in trouble like other men</hi> (nor doth he intimate any viſible Judgments that come upon them in this life.) And can Mr. <hi>R.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf, that the ſins of ſuch men were puniſhed to the full in this life? 2. Becauſe the day of wrath is after this life, even at the coming of Chriſt. See <hi>Job</hi> 21.30. compared with the Text in the Margin<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.9.</note>. 3. Becauſe their ſins make them worthy of everlaſting puniſhment. See the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Book, in anſwer to the queſtion how it is juſt to puniſh temporal offences eternally?</p>
                  <p>But (on the contrary) my Author contends that ſin is puniſhed to the full in this life, or at leaſt he ſaith ſo, if we can take his word for it. But how he will prove it who can tell? For thoſe texts of Scripture which ſpeak of <hi>his pouring out his fury upon the wicked in this life,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.18. are far from proving that there is no wrath for them in another life. Yea, ſo far, as that they will manifeſtly prove the contrary: for if God puniſh ſin in the day of his Patience, how much more will he puniſh it hereafter in the day of his wrath, which is called the <hi>day of the Revelation of his righteous Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>day of perdition to ungodly men,</hi>

And now by all means let us take his infallible proofs, ſince we may have ſo good a bargain in them, <hi>viz.</hi> more than Nineteen to the Dozen, for he mentions no leſs than Twenty of them. And (by the way) was it not ſtrange, (yea moſt exceeding ſtrange) that there ſhould be ſo many proofs of it to be found, and yet none of them appear to the eyes of his many Betters, ſuch as St. <hi>Auſtine, Chryſoſtome, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Beza, Whitaker, Whately, Perkins, Bolton,</hi> (and ſuch like) that are mentioned by my <hi>Author</hi> himſelf, and are confeſſed to be pious, as well as Learned Men.

Juſt thus hath my <hi>Author</hi> done herein; for as it is a truth that revealed things belong to us, ſo it is as apparently falſe, that the Doctrine of Everlaſting Puniſhments for the wicked in Hell, is not revealed in Scripture: See the 1. Chapter of this Book.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> The Devil is a Lyar, and his Servants (to my knowledge) do not always ſpeak true, and many times alſo they have as little of ſhame in them, as they have of truth or goodneſs in them. But how ſhall this (which he hath ſaid) be proved? Why thus.</p>
                  <q>—From thoſe places of Scripture, which speak of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 127.</note> as the proper portion of Believers, as in particular, <hi>John 3. laſt verſe.</hi> He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life: and ſeveral other Scriptures to the ſame purpoſe.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> But if this be an infallible proof, I am very much miſtaken: It is not ſuch indeed, nor doth it look like ſuch to the eyes of them that underſtand it. Let us obſerve the nature of it. [He that believeth not ſhall not ſee life.] whence he would have us conclude, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall not live for ever, and conſequently not live in Puniſhment for ever. But what reaſon is there, why we ſhould make any ſuch conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence? for [to ſee life] in that place doth not ſignifie barely to have life, or to be alive, for ſo it is not a truth, ſince they ſhall live again at the laſt Day, and be raiſed out of their Graves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. yea be raiſed incorruptible, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and many other places. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſee life is a figurative expreſſion, for as by life is ſignified glory and happineſs, (life being naturally the ſweeteſt thing, and ſo very fit to expreſs the ſtate of glory by) ſo by ſeeing is meant enjoying; As when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.3. Heb. 12.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> We know, and are aſſured from the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that every eye ſhall ſee the Lord, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is Lord of all, and by whom all things were created, in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.16. and the moſt part of Men never were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of true holineſs, nor ever will be; and therefore the moſt part ſhall ſee him without holineſs. So that <hi>to ſee</hi> in that place muſt be meant of enjoying the Lord in glory, and ſo we grant none ſhall ſee him, in that ſenſe, without holineſs. And the like may be ſaid of ſeeing good, (or good days) in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. it muſt needs be meant of enjoyment, and partaking that good, as 'tis plain. This therefore is no proof at all of it, (much leſs an infallible proof.)</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54321:47"/>
                  <q>The next attempt which he maketh for the proof of it, is from thoſe places of Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note> where mention is made of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and Deſtruction; <hi>They ſhall be deſtroyed for ever, and the ungodly ſhall periſh,</hi> and the like in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</q>
                  <p>But for my part, I think it is the ſaddeſt deſtruction to be in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate of miſery: This I ſay, is a more dreadful deſtruction, than to be annihilated, and therefore fitteſt to be called a deſtruction: And if he think the word deſtruction muſt ſignifie (of neceſſity) annihilation, and cannot ſignifie a ſtate of miſery and puniſhment, he had beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe difficulties that lye in his way, in my firſt Chapter, where the ſenſe of the word hath been cleared againſt the <hi>Socinians.</hi> And what doth he think (to mention but one Text for many) of the words of our God in <hi>Hoſea, O Iſrael, thou hast deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſea 13.9.</note> Surely he doth not think it is meant, that they had turned themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing, but that (by their ſins) they had brought themſelves into a miſerable condition, and made themſelves liable to greater miſeries.</p>
                  <q>In the following Page he runs very ſwiftly, and diſputes us into abſurdities after this manner,—The Word ſaith,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> There are a ſort of Men in the World that have wit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and ſome kind of Learning too, that yet are little better than fools, for want of grace and holy wiſdom, to make a good uſe of their wits; and therefore we uſe to ſay of them, that they are ſimple and cunning. And whether my <hi>Author</hi> be not ſomewhat of Kin to theſe kind of Men, let my <hi>Reader</hi> judge: For in theſe laſt paſſages there is ſomething of ſubtilty, yea enough to deceive the ignorant and unſtable, and the Men that are inclining to his Opinion: but if we view them narrowly, they will not appear more ſubtile than ſilly. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer runs upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that the deſtruction threatned to the wicked is a Natural deſtruction, whereas it means only a Moral deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>viz.</hi> Condemnation and Puniſhment. (as was ſeen before) But he ſaith, their end is ſaid to be deſtruction, which he thinks is contrary to us, who teach that there ſhall never be an end of them, but that they ſhall always remain under Puniſhment. But it doth not mean as he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54321:48"/>
would have it, that the deſtruction there ſpoken of, doth make an end of them, or imply the diſſolution of their natures; for we have ſeen the contrary before; and if he entertain ſuch a perſwaſion, he may eaſily be brought to believe, (upon the ſame ground) that Everlaſting life (or happineſs) will make an end of the Saints; for 'tis ſaid, <hi>Their end is everlaſting life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.22.</note> Wherefore by [end] we are to underſtand, their final, and unchangeable ſtate and portion in another World; which is everlaſting deſtruction (or miſery) to the wicked, as it is everlaſting life (or glory) to the Righteous. But of this I have ſaid ſomething before.</p>
                  <p>The other labours under as much weakneſs as the former, for (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) it is not ſaid in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that the laſt enemy is Death, (abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if there were no worſe thing to come after) but thus only <hi>[The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26.</note> 
                     <hi>is Death]</hi> where he leaves out that main paſſage, which carries the whole ſenſe of the Text. Juſt as the Devil alledged the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> [he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee] and left out the following words [in all thy ways, or the ways God hath appointed thee to walk in] See <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Muſcul.</hi> in Loc.</note> Now we grant that Death is the laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, though it ſhall not be the laſt evil, that by the wicked ſhall be endured.</p>

The Devils ſhall not have Eternal life in the ſenſe aforeſaid, as it is promiſed to the People of God; but yet they ſhall be eternally alive, (and live the life of ſpiritual ſubſtances) elſe they could not ſuffer eternally in the Everlaſting fire, as we have proved they ſhall.</p>

                     <hi>B.</hi> But as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> was as wiſe a man as himſelf, ſo his ſpeech herein is not ſo abſurd, as he imagines it to be: yea, I doubt not but it is ſound and good; and now I ſhall conſider briefly what he ſaith unto it. 1. [if ſo, then it is not a puniſhment without end:] what warrant he hath to make ſuch an Inference from it, I for my part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand: for what if that Separation be everlaſting (as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54321:49"/>
it to be) then it will be vanity to ſay ſo (yea a contradiction too.) So that this Collection of his is utterly groundleſs, unleſs he underſtand this Separation to be by Annihilation; and if he do ſo, I have ſhewed the abſurdity of it ſufficiently already (in diſproving the Doctrine of the Annihilation of the wicked.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>2. R.</hi>—If they be any where, how can they be abſent from God, ſeeing God is every where—</q>
                  <p>But certainly he muſt be a very ſilly man that can think Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> was ſuch a fool as to ſuppoſe that they could be abſent from the Lord in a proper ſenſe, or out of his preſence. I dare ſay that was very far from his mind: and he needed no more to be taught the doctrine of God's Omnipreſence, than wicked men need to be comforted by his Book (againſt the fears of Damnation:) yet becauſe he hath mentioned the word [Abſent from God] I may lawfully put him in mind of that Text of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.6.</note> in 2 <hi>Cor. while we are at home in the body we are abſent from the Lord:</hi> he did not think, he and the reſt of the Faithful were where God is not, while they lived in this world, and yet he expreſſes it after that manner: becauſe here they were as it were abſent from the comfortable preſence of God, in compariſon of that comfort which their Souls ſhould have in his Glorious Preſence after they had left their bodies. So in this caſe we mean by the Second Death, the total and perpetual: Separation of the wicked and impenitent from the comfortable Preſence, and the glorious Preſence of God;<note place="margin">Luke. 13.28.</note> as when they ſhall be ſhut out of his glorious Kingdom, and depart from Chriſt to dwell with the Devil and his Angels. And though this be not a death (properly ſo called) yet it may fitly be called by that name, becauſe of the terror of it, (Death being naturally the moſt terrible thing) as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is fitly called Paradiſe, for the pleaſure and purity of it,<note place="margin">Luke 23.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

See <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                  <p>And thus having vindicated Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> from Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s cavils, I ſhall paſs over the idle diſcourſes of the 139 and 140 <hi>pages,</hi> and ſpeak a few words of that which ſeems more worthy of my cenſure, in 141 <hi>page,</hi> thus,

                     <hi>B.</hi> This is a rare piece of Learning indeed, and ſuch as the common ſort of Preachers never had the confidence to teach their hearers either from the Pulpit or the Preſs. But that it may not be thought better of than it deſerves, let us examine it briefly: the main ſtrength of his Speech lies in this [That God hath not ſaid that thoſe wicked ones mentioned in that place, were worthy of any more than death] true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were worthy of no more puniſhment than death, for that death there ſpoken of is nothing leſs than eternal Damnation: And thus the unpardonable ſin,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.16.</note> called by St. <hi>John, a ſin unto death,</hi> that is, ſuch a ſin as neceſſarily and infallibly brings eternal damnation upon the ſinner.

Surely it is more than bad enough to doubt whether there be any thing to come after Death or not; much worſe to hold abſolutely, that there is not; for that contradicts the Scriptures, which tell us, that after Death there is a Judgment, and a Vengeance to be inflicted on them that obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9.27.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> and in a word everlaſting ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, (to the wicked, he means) <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But for a Man to act Mr. <hi>R.</hi>'s part, and to urge Holy Scripture in defence of ſuch a Heatheniſh Opinion, who can imagine how horrible a thing it is in the eyes of God, (I doubt not but he would ſuffer worſe than corporal Death for it, if God ſhould deal with him after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, what ever ſlight thoughts he hath of it) And how far theſe words <hi>[The end of theſe things is Death]</hi> I ſay how far theſe words are from proving, that there is no Puniſhment for any after Death, is ſo plain, that there's little need of any thing to be ſaid about it, for Death here ſignifies (as before) Eternal damnation: As when it is ſaid, <hi>if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye,</hi> that is, be Damned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. (for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they live, they are as much ſubject to temporal Death, as 'tis clear.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Proof</hi> 3d. <hi>R.</hi>—Their Opinion of a Puniſhment never to end makes not ſin,<note place="margin">p. 146.</note> but Christ to be the cauſe of their ſo ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for if Christ had not come, there had been no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and if no Reſurrection there could be no Puniſhment after Death: But Chriſt may not be ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of their Puniſhment, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>B.</hi> If this be a Proof, it is a very ugly one certainly, and will not be much valued by them that know what Chriſt, or Sin, or Puniſhment is. However, I ſhall not think much to ſay ſomething to it. I confeſs Chriſt is ſaid to be the cauſe of the Reſurrection of the Dead: He is the efficient cauſe of the Reſurrection of the wicked, as he is God of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father; and he is the Meritorious cauſe of the Reſurrection of the Saints, as their Head and Mediator. (I mean as their Reſurrection is a glorious Reſurrection, in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.11. <hi>If by any means I may attain to the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi>

after Death: Chriſt is the cauſe of their Reſurrection, (if they be raiſed) therefore if they ſuffer for ever, Chriſt is the cauſe of it, which is abſurd — This is manifeſtly his Proof in this matter: and how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd it is, may be ſhewed in a Parallel caſe, as thus: [Without life and ſtrength Men could not rob on the High-way: but it is God that gives them life and ſtrength, and without him they could not have them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is the cauſe of their Robbing] Would not a Chriſtian abhor ſuch a Reaſoning as this, yea, would not the Devil himſelf be almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it? and yet if I am not moſt exceedingly miſtaken, it is as good a Reaſoning as that of his, yea the very ſame in kind. If he had not forgotten all his Logick he might have remembred, that <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> is not a cauſe ſtrictly and properly ſo called, but only a pre-requiſite condition, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>And in the following Lines, he aſſures us, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> compares the ſtate of the Damned, in, and under Puniſhment, to the troubles of a Married ſtate here in the World: which was ſuch a piece of wiſdome, as his Parents (I dare ſay) did never teach him.

                     <label>Anſwered.</label> 
                     <hi>I anſwer:</hi> There is mention made of it implicitly and in ſubſtance, though not expreſly in thoſe very words: For it is ſaid, that <hi>he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from the curſe of the Law, Gal.</hi> 3. and <hi>from the wrath to come,</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. laſt verſe.

                  <p>And here under this fourth Proof, for many Pages together, from the 150. to 161. he hath ſuch a wild Diſcourſe, as his Reader, I dare ſay, never met with in any other Book whatſoever: I ſhall not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it at large, (for why ſhould my time be ſpent ſo vainly, eſpecially conſidering how much of uſefuller work I have to do) but ſhall only preſent thee with ſome of the choiceſt flowers therein, which will ſmell no whit better than ſtinking weeds: And the firſt is thus:
<q>

                           <hi>p.</hi> 151.</note>
                        <hi>R.</hi>— If a Puniſhment for ever be due to man for ſin, Christ muſt have ſuffered for ever to free us from it.—</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> In theſe words we may note firſt his Opinion, and ſecondly his Proof of it. His Opinion (which they diſcover) is this, That ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment is not due to Man for ſin, or that he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be puniſhed for ever for his ſin: It ſeems then, though he prayed for ſome things, (as he tells us in the Epiſtle to the Reader) yet he never prayed to be delivered from endleſs puniſhment, as ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his betters have done, (and if God ſhould caſt him into it, he muſt not find fault, ſince he never deſired him to ſave him from it.) And hereby we may perceive how far he goes beyond the very worſt of Papiſts and Sectariſts that are among us. The one, though they have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54321:52"/>
too many ſilly Dreams about Purgatory, yet they do not doubt of the Everlaſtingneſs of hell Torments, or of the deſert of them by the ſins of men, being taught the one and the other by their great Maſters in the Catholick Faith, as <hi>Bellarm. de amiſſ. grat.</hi> l. 1. cap. 14. <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>diſp.</hi> 6. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 17. <hi>punct.</hi> 4. and others, who cite the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for it largely enough.<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Baronii</hi> disp. de Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mortali. &amp;c. part. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> And the other, though they are little in love with our Liturgie in general, or our Letany in particular, yet they count it no Superſtition to pray as we do therein [from Everlaſting Damnation, Good Lord deliver us] So that he differs herein from theſe perſons, as much as from Orthodox Proteſtants, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And ſeeing he is ſingular herein, he had need give us a very good Proof of his Opinion before he may hope to win us to it. But behold what it is!</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>R.</hi> [If everlaſting puniſhment be due to us for ſin, then if Chriſt free us from it, he muſt ſuffer everlaſtingly himſelf.]</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> But this will need a proof as much as the other, and when he or his Brethren ſhall undertake to prove it, I will undertake to Anſwer them. And to that which he hath ſaid, I reply thus: That Chriſts Sufferings in the place of his people were ſufficient to deliver them from everlaſting puniſhment, though he did not ſuffer for ever, for his Temporal Sufferings were of infinite merit and value, as being the Sufferings of an Infinite Perſon, the Eternal Son of God, whom all the Higheſt Angels are enjoyned to worſhip, or in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s phraſe, <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> For like as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Injury is meaſured by the greatneſs of the perſon that ſuffers it, ſo the value of the ſatisfaction is eſteemed by the Excellency of the Perſon that makes the Satisfaction, as is well obſerved by the excellent and acute Author in the Margin, in his <hi>Anatome Samoſatenianiſmi,</hi>

ſuppoſe the dignity of Chriſt's perſon, as he is God, to add ſuch a value to his Sufferings (that his Temporal Sufferings may ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our Eternal Sufferings) he gives us this for Anſwer, [That the Godhead of Chriſt did not ſuffer] which I confeſs is a Truth, but nothing at all to the purpoſe, for though his Godhead did not ſuffer, yet he, who is God, did ſuffer, (though only in his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.)

For though we may be ſure that all they are loſt for ever (and beyond all hopes of recovery) that die unconverted, yet we cannot be ſo ſure of ſuch and ſuch particular perſons, that they did die unconverted: for God's Judgments are a great deep and his Ways paſt finding out; God may work his gracious work in the Soul, at the laſt minute of life, if he ſo pleaſe, and we cannot prove that he will not do ſo.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> THis is the ſubſtance of his proof. And if it be ſufficient to prove what he intends by it,<note place="margin">God's mercy, and Parents pity, not alike in all things.</note> it will be ſufficient for other purpoſes too, which Chriſtians will not judge it to be, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the Devils ſhall not ſuffer extreme puniſhments without end; and that Chriſt was not puniſhed (extremely) for the offences of ſuch as we. For the former, we will take his Argument and urge it thus, [Parents would not deſire to caſt their Children into an irrecoverable ſtate of miſery, upon their firſt act of diſobedience towards them: How can we think then, that God would caſt the Angels (that were the nobleſt of all the works of his hands) into an irrecoverable ſtate of miſery, upon the commiſſion of the firſt ſin againſt him? for God is not leſs merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Man.]</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs the Proof is as ſtrong this way, as the other way, and yet it is not ſtrong enough, nor will not (cannot) prevail upon them that believe what the Scripture ſaith in the caſe: for let us prove what we will, yet the Apoſtle hath told us,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.

(And therefore whatſoever proofs are brought to the contrary, are not Proofs truly ſo called, but Sophiſtical Arguments and meer deceits.)</p>
                  <p>For the latter alſo we may reaſon (as ſtrongly) after the ſame rate. [A good Father would not have his beloved Son (that never offended
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54321:56"/>
him) be ſeverely puniſhed for thoſe offences that he never committed, therefore much leſs would the God of all Mercy lay the puniſhment of our ſins upon his Holy Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in whom his Soul delighted.] One Egg is not more like another than this is like my Author's Proof afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And though it might be approved by <hi>Socinians,</hi> yet Chriſtians will not be wrought upon by it,<note place="margin">Eſay 53.</note> while they read and believe <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8 and, in one word, the 53d. Chapter of <hi>Eſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen how far this his Proof is from being infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and therefore the <hi>Reader</hi> will not think I am bound to ſay any thing more unto it; yet for his farther ſatisfaction, I will add thus much: <hi>viz.</hi> That God is not as Man in every thing, (for then he ſhould not be a God indeed) nor may his goodneſs and Man's be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, any farther than the Scriptures will allow of: And though he be more merciful than Man is, and will ſhew forth more love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the meaneſt of his faithful ſervants, than the moſt compaſſionate Parent ever did (or can do) to his beloved Child; yet his ſaving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath its proper objects, and is not extended promiſcuouſly to all the Sons of Men. He is free in the exerciſing of it, and hath mercy on whom he will: And his Mercy no more binds him to ſave All Men, than it did to ſave all Angels: The wicked and impenitent are the objects of his wrath, as the Returning ſinners are the objects of his love. Again, God is not only a God of Mercy,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.1.</note> but a God of Vengeance. <hi>To him vengeance belongeth,</hi> Pſal. 94. where the word vengeance, is mentioned twice in one verſe; And he is the Supreme Law-giver and Governour of the World. Now as he is ſuch, it belongs to him to ſee that his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and uncurable Enemies may not go unpuniſhed: And though he deſires not their puniſhment for everlaſting, (to uſe Mr. <hi>R.</hi>'s word) as it is a puniſhment, yet he will inflict it, as it is an Execution of Juſtice, and a diſcovery of his holineſs, and hatred of ſin, and the like. And (to come to the compariſon) a Father, that is a Judge and a Law-giver, as well as a Father, and (as ſuch) hath made a Law that ſuch and ſuch offenders ſhall ſuffer ſo many Months impriſonment, who ever they be; may not diſpenſe with that Law, (if it be juſt) no not in the caſe of his own Children, when they commit the ſaid offences. So the God of Mercy being a Judge and Law-giver, is engaged by his Honour and Juſtice to puniſh ſin, (which is the tranſgreſſion of his Law) according to its deſert. If you ſay it is not puniſhed upon the Saints, <hi>I anſwer:</hi> That it was puniſhed upon their Surety Chriſt Jeſus in their place, and they are freed by the merit of his ſufferings: But it is not ſo with the Enemies of his holineſs, ſo remaining; they muſt anſwer for themſelves.</p>

For (ſaith he) why may not God ſhew ſo much mercy, as not to inflict it upon them that deſerve it, as he gives the rain to them that deſerve it not.— <hi>I anſwer,</hi> He doth ſhew ſo much mercy upon many ſuch, (yea many thouſands) as not to inflict it on them: All that truly turn from their evil ways, and believe on his Son Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall for his ſake be ſecured from it, and he will ſpare them, <hi>as a man spareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi> But if he ask,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.16, 17.</note> why he may not ſhew ſuch mercy upon all in general, or upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that continue ſuch, Then I except againſt his queſtion; for we are not concerned (in this caſe) to enquire what he may do, but what he will do. Things revealed (by his own confeſſion) belong to us, now he hath revealed his will to the contrary, as in other places, ſo in that ſo often mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:</hi> and, to take vengeance of them that know not God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> (But he hath not ſaid he will give them no Rain while they live on Earth, and therefore is free to give it them, though they deſerve it not.) So that for a Man to ask, why God may not ſhew ſuch favour to the Impenitent, as not to inflict ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon them, is in effect, to ask, why he may not act contrary to his own word? which is a queſtion more fit to be abhorred than to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>And what if Parents ſhew more kindneſs to diſobedient Children than they deſerve, yet he muſt not think that Men are a fit rule for God to walk by; nor doth he believe that God is bound to ſhew ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his rebellious Creatures, as Men are to their diſobedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. (yet it muſt be remembred, that God doth ſhew a thouſand times more kindneſs to his enemies in this World, than they deſerve, or could deſerve, if they were his faithfulleſt ſervants, and doth more for them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day in the Year, than Parents can do for their beſt Children.) And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54321:57"/>
theſe things being conſidered, all that which he adds concerning the greatneſs of God's Mercy above the mercy of man, is vain as to that for which he intends it: But of that we may have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter.</p>

But let us come to the point.— Our Opinion (he ſaith) leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeneth the goodneſs of God and limiteth it unto a few:] concerning which we would demand of him, what he means by God's goodneſs? If he means God's common goodneſs, it is utterly denyed: our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on denyes not the extent of that goodneſs to all; though we believe a Hell, yet we believe God is good to all here, and he therefore caſts ſome into Hell becauſe they would not be (truly) good to themſelves, nor chuſe the good ways which he commands them to walk in. But if he mean it of God's ſaving goodneſs, then I ſay our Opinion denyes it to extend to all (ſo as to ſave All) for <hi>narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few there be that find it. (i.e.</hi> few in compariſon,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note> or not near ſo many as miſs of it, though very many conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.) But he tells us [All fleſh ſhall ſee his Salvation] very true, who doubts of it? But he that dares believe his Saviour (in that Text but now mentioned) will not think that it means that all without exception ſhall be Saved; and if it were ſo, then I ſay, what Divinity, yea what truth or ſence (to ſpeak with Reverence) ſhall be found in the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, We are a ſweet ſavour, &amp;c.</hi> in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh: (what ſhall become of this diviſion of mankind into [them that are ſaved] and them that [pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh] if All ſhould be ſaved and none periſh?)

appear that [<hi>All</hi> in thoſe Texts, means all whatſoever, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any;] which I dare ſay he cannot do, nor could it agree with the other places alledged, if taken in that ſence: wherefore by All, we mean All ſorts (that Repent and Believe) ſuch perſons of what ſort ſoever, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> high or low, bond or free, <hi>&amp;c. ſhall ſee the Salvation of God.</hi> As when it is ſaid, our Lord healed all Diſeaſes among the people, <hi>i. e.</hi> all ſorts; and in another, <hi>ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 10.22.</note> that is, of all ſorts of men, for certainly All in general did not hate them for Chriſts ſake, yea ſome loved them as truly for it, as others hated them.</p>

                     </note>And the other Text may be vindicated with no leſs difficulty than the former.

But yet in caſe they prove Thieves or Murderers, or unſufferable Enemies to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in any other way, he wills that they ſhould die for it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them to be put to death. (and that without any diſparagement to his goodneſs and merciful diſpoſition) So in caſe men will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their wicked ways, and turn to God and his true ſervice, the Judge of the world doth will their deſerved Puniſhment, and will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with an Everlaſting deſtruction<note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.9.</note> (and that without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his Mercy and Goodneſs) In a word, he doth not ſo will the Salvation of All in general, as to bring them to Salvation; that's plain, ſince <hi>ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to Salvation,</hi>

Briefly thus: The riches of God's grace and goodneſs is ſeen in the excellency of its effect. For Life is a more excellent thing than Death, and Righteouſneſs than Sin; and (ſecondly) in the powerfulneſs of the work, for it argueth a greater power to ſave than to deſtroy, to juſtifie than to condemn: (as 'tis a greater matter to reform a few, than to corrupt and harden a great many againſt the holy Ordinances and ways of God: An Idle Hypocrite is too well able to do the one, but a painful Miniſter is ſcarce able to do the other.)</p>
                  <p>And (by the way) we do not ſay, as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> that God hath made the beſt World, (or Heaven) but for a very few: For many ſhall come from the Eaſt and the Weſt, and ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven; yet they are few in compariſon of them that miſs of Heaven,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note> as was ſeen before from the words of him, whom he dares not (I hope) contradict or cavil at.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54321:60"/>
for he may think it much more a denying of his goodneſs to ſay that he hath made comfortable proviſions for the Birds and Beaſts, and at the ſame time reſerved many thouſands of mighty Angels for extream and everlaſting puniſhment: Yet ſo it is, whether my <hi>Author</hi> allow of it or not: he that ſpares the one did not ſpare the other.

And how little excellency is to be found in ſuch Imaginations may appear in theſe particulars following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Saints do not deſire that any ſhould fall ſhort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but would rather deſire to further all men in the way to it, yet I dare ſay God will not bring all men thither.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saints do not deſire that any man ſhould be mocked or abuſed, impriſoned or tormented in the world for maintaining the Truth, and oppoſing the Abominations of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; yet it would be madneſs to ſay God would not let his people ſuffer ſo upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe it agrees not to the mind of a Saint; for Experience ſhews he hath often been pleaſed to exerciſe his people with ſuch tryals, witneſs the Book of Martyrs, and the Hiſtories of the former Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man of much Sanctity would not deſire there ſhould be ſo much wickedneſs in the world as there is, no nor would not ſuffer it to be if he could help it. I my ſelf would turn all men to the love of God and Holineſs if it were in my power: That little goodneſs that is in my heart (alas too little, and indeed ſo little that I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afraid it is none at all in ſincerity, yet that) doth ſo diſpoſe me, that I would turn all, if wiſhing or Preaching would do it, and would not ſuffer any man to love a pair of Cards more than a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or a Barrel of Beer, or a Bag of Money more than Chriſt, and Grace, and Heaven, nor would I ſuffer men and women to play the Hypocrite for God's ſake, and ſtay at home like <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> on the Lord's Day, under pretence of ſpending their time in Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54321:61"/>
in private. (whoſe baſe Hypocriſie the Lord will laugh at, for he knoweth that his Day is coming) I ſay, I my ſelf would not ſuffer theſe things if I could help it. Yet God we ſee, doth ſuffer them, and yet his goodneſs is greater than man's.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I verily believe, a Saint (that is eminently ſuch for knowledge and Grace) would not have ſuffered Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to have ſpent his time ſo ſadly as to write This Book I am engaged with, yet God hath ſuffered him to Write and to Publiſh it too, or elſe it could never have been.—And that which he ſaith of the mercifulneſs of the Saints to their worſt Enemies, is as far from being unanſwerable: and becauſe He hath not urged this Argument to the beſt advantage, I will do it for him, as thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[A good man would not puniſh his enemies eternally, therefore God will not ſo puniſh his, for he is more merciful than Man.]</hi> I Anſwer, If God may not do otherwiſe than a good man would do, what ſad concluſions might we make from it? for at this rate we might conclude that God the Father would not leave his beloved Son Chriſt Jeſus to the malice of his wicked enemies, to be mocked and ſpit upon, to be Crucified and ſlain by them, for a good man would not deal ſo by his beloved Son; yet ſo it was, as ſure as the Goſpel is true, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. and other places.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no Reaſon why any man ſhould puniſh his enemy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly; for his enemy doth not deſerve it as he is his enemy: that is, his enmity againſt him, as it is againſt him, doth not make him worthy of ſuch puniſhment. But offences againſt God, as they are againſt God, do deſerve ſuch puniſhment, and make the offenders wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it. (as before.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men are but men, and therefore Vengeance is not their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative as it is Gods: <hi>To him it belongeth, Pſ.</hi> 94.1. Neither are they Governors of the World, by natural rightful Soveraignty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a mans fault as againſt them, doth not reſpect any ſuch Law, by which the world muſt be governed: But enough of this.</p>

                     <hi>R.</hi> Such puniſhment agrees not to the Nature of God, for God is Love, and is kind to the unthankful and the evil. <hi>Luke 6.</hi> If God ſhould only Love them that love him, do not the Publicans the ſame?

                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of this 15th. Proof, and is large enough if good enough. To the firſt part I reply—If it be contrary to God's Nature to puniſh ſin for ever, then the Devils ſhould not be puniſhed by him for ever, the contrary to which we have ſeen already: 2. If it be contrary to God's Nature to puniſh ſin for ever (it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Nature to preſerve the ſinners Being for ever, and when he will ever be a ſinner, and ſo ever worthy of puniſhment) I ſay if it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54321:62"/>
be contrary to his Nature to puniſh ſin thus, becauſe he is a God of Love, it would be as contrary to his Nature to ſuffer ſin to be in the World, becauſe he is a God of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſay, He is Love Eſſentially; I ſay in like manner, he is Holineſs Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, and when he would ſwear by himſelf, he ſwears by his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and elſewhere. And if the matter be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I do not queſtion, but it will appear a ſtranger thing, that God ſhould ſuffer ſin to be committed, than that he ſhould puniſh it, as it deſerves after it is committed. (eſpecially where it is attended with final impenitence, as in the Damned.) 3. God is a God of vengeance, as well as of love: and as the Saints are objects of his love, ſo the wicked and impenitent are the objects of his wrath; and <hi>the wrath of God abideth on them:</hi> John 3. v. <hi>ult.</hi>

                        <hi>p.</hi> 170.</note> he hath ſome ſpecial good which he beſtoweth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſome perſons, as Heaven or Salvation only upon the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> So that though God may be ſaid to love all Men after a ſort,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54321:63"/>
yet he doth not ſo love the wicked that remain ſuch, as to give them Pardon and Salvation. If Mr. <hi>R.</hi> hath any proofs to the contrary, we deſire him to bring them forth to light, and ſhall readily (if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) examine them to the full.</p>
                  <p>Well, but he is Infinite in Mercy, and delighteth in Mercy.— Very true: But may he not appear to be Infinite in Mercy, unleſs he ſave his impenitent Enemies? Sure he may. And though he delighteth in Mercy, yet he hath Veſſels of Wrath as well as of Mercy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth wrath for his Enemies;<note place="margin">Nahum 1.2.</note> and when he will be pouring out his wrath upon them, yet then he will diſcover his delight in Mercy (and the infiniteneſs of his Mercy) to Thouſands and Thouſands of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants.</p>

                  <p>But firſt: The word ſtrange in that place is expounded by ſome of a great and wonderful work, and of an extraordinary judgment: and if we take it this way, it is far from ſerving his purpoſe, ſo much as in ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Or, ſecondly, It may be taken for ſuch a work as flows not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him, but is occaſioned, and as it were enforced by the ſins and provocations of Men. As in a Father to his Child; His comforting of it and providing for it, is his natural work, which his natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction moves him to; But his threatning or correcting of it, is (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other) his ſtrange work, which he doth not as a Parent, but as an offended Parent.</p>
                  <p>Thus puniſhing is God's ſtrange work, ſuch as he doth not as he is God, but as he is an offended God: and yet this work of his may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever; as we have an Example in the fallen Angels. And I think his everlaſting puniſhment is more plainly (as well as more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) diſcovered againſt wicked Men, than it is againſt wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Death of Chriſt is ſo far from diſproving our Doctrine, that it doth moſt ſtrongly confirm it; For if God did puniſh his Son with an accurſed Death, when he bare the ſins of his People in this World, what wonder is it if he puniſh the impenitent with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curſe (or puniſhment) in the World to come?

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54321:64"/>
his love. (which is ſuch a ſpeech, as I have ſeldome met with in any Book, but yours.) If it be meant of God's faithful Servants, of humble and penitent ſinners, I grant that his love will overcome (in due time) all their ſins, and be magnified towards them by pardon here, and glory hereafter:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.35.</note> for, <hi>What ſhall ſeparate them from the love of Christ? Rom.</hi> 8. But if he ſpeak of the proud contemners of his Word and ways, and the deceitful workers of iniquity, that continue ſuch, then though we care not to ſay that their ſin doth overcome his love, yet we confidently affirm, that it will ſo provoke his wrath, as to cauſe him to puniſh them for ever in the life to come: See <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. <hi>Pſal</hi> 92.7. and many other places.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Aſſertion [That God's mercy is greater than ſin] hath been ſpoken to already, and I need now to ſay but this about it: That it is greater than the ſin of Devils, and yet Devils ſhall ſuffer for ever for their ſins. (and ſo we may ſay, God's healing power is ſtronger and greater than Diſeaſes, and yet Men dye by them for all that.)</p>
                  <p>His third Aſſertion, That the grace of God is to all, even to the worſt of Men; if it be meant of his ſaving grace, (or ſuch mercy as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſalvation) is a groſs untruth: for the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned, Mark</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 16. (And his other, That all the ſins of all Men ſhall be forgiven, is as loud an Error, and let him prove it a truth, if he can.)</p>
                  <p>Thus much for his Vanity. His Subtilty follows, [Where ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds grace much more abounds;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> therefore the grace of God abounds to all ſinners, yea to the worſt, for ſin abounds moſt in them. And if they ſuffer eternally, How doth grace (or mercy) abound to them?] —Yea doubtleſs, this is the Beaſt that carries the Bell, but let us pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it a little,<note place="margin">His groſs abuſe of Rom. 5.20.</note> and we ſhall perceive that 'tis not a pretty Creature, but a horrible deformed Monſter. For I dare challenge Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and all his Brethren, yea all Mankind to ſhew me any one Text of Scripture, that ever was more abominably abuſed, more wretchedly wreſted (whether by <hi>Papiſts, Socinians, Atheiſts,</hi> or any ſort of Men) than this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, in this caſe, by Him. For when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>where ſin did abound, grace did abound much more;</hi> he doth not mean, that God will ſhew himſelf moſt gracious to them that have committed the moſt or greateſt ſins; for then <hi>Pharaoh, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſhould be more bleſſed than <hi>Moſes, Joſeph,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> And our Damners and Sinkers be more happy than the holy Prophets, Apoſtles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: For ſin hath moſt abounded in them, (if we take Mr. <hi>R.</hi> his ſenſe of the word) But the abounding there mentioned, is the abounding of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54321:64"/>
it in the ſenſe and feeling of the ſinner; that God's gracious goodneſs hath appeared moſt wonderful in the eyes of thoſe Penitent ſinners, to whom ſin hath appeared moſt vile and hateful. That the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin in that place is of this nature, the words juſt before will make evident, for we read thus (therein) <hi>the Law entred that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence might abound.</hi> Surely it was not given to make men abound the more in ſin, or to make them more ſinful, than otherwiſe they would be: but to make men more ſenſible of ſin, and of the evil of it. The Law, ſaith that Learned Expoſitor upon the place, <hi>auget peccatum,</hi>

Thus I have given an Anſwer to his Proof, and if he like it not, he may confute it if he can.</p>

                     <hi>R.</hi>— It is no profit or pleaſure to God to have any man ſuffer endleſs Torments; He hath no pleaſure in the death of any, <hi>Ezek. 18.</hi> much leſs can it be any pleaſure to him for any ſo to ſuffer. <hi>Hoſea 6.6</hi> He is ſaid to deſire Mercy and not Sacrifice: if ſo, he deſires none ſhould be ſacrificed in a torment never to end. God abhors cruelty.—</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> This kind of Reaſoning is ſuch as may well become a man of his Principles, and ſuits ſo fully to his bleſſed deſign, and to what he had ſaid in other places, that we need not doubt but he was guided (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) by the ſelf ſame Spirit. The former part of it contains theſe two Propoſitions. 1. That it is no profit to God to have any man ſuffer endleſs puniſhments. 2. That it is no pleaſure to him.—</p>
                  <p>For the firſt I ſay thus: That if that would prove that God will not have any man ſuffer for ever, at the ſame rate of Reaſoning he might prove, that none of the wicked Angels ſhall ſuffer for ever. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is no more profited by their ſufferings, than by the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſinful men; and yet Chriſtians will believe that the wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall ſuffer for ever, and I have ſhewed ſome reaſon why they ſhould believe ſo. It was no profit to God to make the world (for what need could he have of it who had All-ſufficiency in himſelf?) and yet Mr. <hi>R.</hi> doth grant that God hath made it: He grants alſo that God will make his Saints happy and glorious in Heaven, and yet (I believe) he is not ſo weak as to imagine, that God hath any need of their Happineſs and Glory: nor had he any need of the Death of his enemies in this world, and therefore could not be profited by their deaths, and yet he hath brought them to death very often, and in the moſt remarkable manner.</p>
                  <p>His Second Propoſition is this: That 'tis no pleaſure to God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any man (or any wicked man) for ever— If he mean 'tis no ſuch pleaſure to him, as 'tis to have them obey him, or that he is not ſo pleaſed with their miſery as he is with their obedience, or with their happineſs in caſe they were obedient; Then we may grant it without wrong to our cauſe. But if he mean, that God's pleaſure is not in it, in any ſenſe, then I deny it: for it is the good pleaſure of his will to puniſh the impenitent as ſurely as it is to give the Kingdom of Heaven to his Saints. They ſhall ſuffer everlaſting puniſhment, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it:<note place="margin">Matth. 25.46.</note> and ſince they ſuffer it not beſides the good pleaſure of his Will, or contrary to it, they ſuffer it with his Will,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54321:65"/>
or agreeable to it. The Text of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ch. 18.23. runs thus: <hi>Have I any pleaſure that the wicked ſhould dye (or be damned) and not that he ſhould return from his ways and live?</hi> And ſo the ſenſe is clear againſt him, more than for him; and he hath no way to make it appear to be for him, but only to mention the firſt part of the verſe, without the ſecond, wherein he acts like you know whom, (See <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11.) take the words together as they lye, <hi>Have I any pleaſure that the wicked ſhould die, and not that he return, &amp;c.</hi> and then it is as much as if he had ſaid, I take more pleaſure to have them turn and be ſaved, than to have them go on in ſin and be damned: But if they will not turn, they ſhall not be ſaved, nor eſcape damnation, and therefore, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> ſaith the Lord in the ſame Book, plainly ſhewing us, that they muſt dye (or be damned) if they go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes and never turn.</p>
                  <p>But the latter part of this Proof is (if poſſible) more ſtrange than the former, <hi>viz. — God deſires Mercy and not Sacrifice, therefore he deſires not that any ſhould be ſacrificed in a puniſhment never to end.</hi>— As for his Expreſſion of mens being Sacrificed in puniſhment for ever, I do not well approve of it, and could eaſily prove it to be very unfit; for the puniſhment of the wicked is not a Sacrifice for their ſins, ſince it makes no atonement for them (either Typically or Really) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of that, he might more fitly draw his Concluſion thus: Therefore he deſires not that any ſhould ſuffer puniſhment for ever. Now obſerve, <hi>Reader,</hi> the ſtrength of this Argument: <hi>God deſires mercy and not Sacrifice, therefore he will not puniſh any man eternally.</hi> How could he ſpeak more at random if he had ſtriven to do it? for This is meant of his Preceptive will, namely that he values obedience in the general, or the exerciſe of Mercy and works of Love, (in particular) more than Sacrifices at the hands of his people, for the particle there uſed is not an abſolute Negative, but a Comparative only, as in the Text before, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Rivet. in</hi> Hoſ. 6.6.</note> where the Particle [not] doth not deny his pleaſure to puniſh, but compares his will of puniſhing with his will of returning, and of their Salvation in caſe they turn in Truth, and prefers the latter before the former. Now if we do but ſtate the matter thus, and infer the concluſion according to the ſenſe of the Text, it will need little or nothing more to be ſaid for its confutation: for who ſees not the vanity of this Argument—God regards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Charity and Works of mercy, more than Sacrifices, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none ſhall be puniſhed for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he will take leave to infer thus, I will give him leave to make the ſame concluſion from the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54321:66"/>
Hiſtory of <hi>Job's Cattel,</hi> or the <hi>fiery Tails of Sampſons Foxes.</hi> He concludes this Proof with a very great truth [That God abhors cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty] but 'tis ſuch a Truth as little concerns either his deſign it ſelf, or the things that he had ſaid immediately before, but is brought in by the head and ſhoulders, and is forced to ſtand in this improper place by the meer violence of his Reſolute Pen.</p>
                  <p>If he would make it ſerve his turn, he muſt (of neceſſity) make it appear, that God cannot puniſh an impenitent ſinner everlaſtingly without being cruel; which, I am confident, he cannot do, and do verily hope he will not undertake to do. And if he think ſo, I might eaſily ſubdue his error, if it be not maintained by an invincible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, and that by telling him wherein the cruelty of a puniſhment conſiſteth; to wit, not in the duration of it, or degree of it, but in the nature and merit of it. As firſt, when the perſon puniſhed is not fit to bear the puniſhment, as if a man ſhould puniſh the perverſeneſs of a child with a Rack, inſtead of a Rod; or as if he ſhould diſown and diſinherit him for ſome ſmaller acts of diſobedience to him. This were cruelty, becauſe the puniſhment in the one is of ſuch a nature as is unfit for the child to bear; and in the other, becauſe 'tis ſuch as is not due for ſuch an offence, nor deſerved by it, (as it reſpects man) (And therefore our honeſt Profeſſors, that revile and reproach us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind our backs for preaching God's word, and taking their Tythes, and make lyes of us, for telling them the ſad Truths that concern them, are like enough to be indicted for cruelty, when the Judge of the world ſhall come; for though theſe things through his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, do not hurt us much, yet they are things that are not deſerved upon the former accounts, and therefore are no better than cruelties in the eyes of him whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve.)</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, though a puniſhment be never ſo great and grievous, yet if it be ſuch as the perſon puniſhed doth deſerve for his offence, it is not cruelty but juſtice. That wretched Villain <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> that murthered that Renouned King of <hi>France</hi> in his Coach (King <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth, if I miſtake not) was afterwards taken and Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death in a fearful manner, yet I believe there were few honeſt men that ever accuſed his Judge of cruelty, for condemning him to ſuch a death, becauſe (they knew) he had well deſerved it, by the horrid crime he had committed.</p>
                  <p>And now having taken ſo much pains to make good his bad cauſe, in the nineteen Proofs that we have ſeen, there is no doubt but he will make the beſt uſe he can of his ſtrength and skill, in his 20th.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54321:66"/>

                  <p>But by his leave, I judge otherwiſe, and do not doubt but it is for his glory, to impoſe great Puniſhment upon the wicked, namely for the glory of his Juſtice (which he doth not ſo much as pretend to diſprove, unleſs it be by telling us, that glory conſiſteth in mercy and forgiveneſs; for which he alledgeth <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.

ſave all Men, than to ſave ſome only, he may enjoy his Opinion, but ought not to impoſe it upon us, as an undoubted truth, without a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof, which he hath not been pleas'd to give us. The Apoſtle ſpeaks (all in a Verſe) of them that are ſaved,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.</note> and of them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. Surely then God doth not ſave all, (for we read of ſome that periſh) but he doth what is moſt for his glory, ſaith Mr. <hi>R.</hi> himſelf. Therefore it is not moſt for his glory to ſave all (or to ſave the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.) And if it were moſt for his glory to ſave all Men, why would it not be moſt for his glory to ſave all the Angels too, for is not their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as noble, and their ſalvation as precious as Man's? And yet he will not ſave the wicked Angels, (as was proved) therefore it appears he did not count it moſt for his glory ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>And if I ſhould ſay, that the ſaving of ſome only (only the Penitent and Returning ſinners; I ſpeak of them that are of years) tends moſt to the glory of God's mercy, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> may not honeſtly deny it: for his juſt ſeverity and vengeance upon ſome ſets off his mercy towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <p>But however they value earthly things, becauſe they are moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54321:68"/>
to their earthly minds, yet aſſuredly they have not that goodneſs in them which they expect to find, at leaſt not that which can be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the principal affection and eſteem of their hearts: and that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of that little good that they are able to do for them in this life, for they cannot give any ſound content to an Immortal Soul. (That which is capable of God can never be filled with the Creature.) Where is the Man that ever was ſatisfied with the greateſt Riches, that had not ſomething better than his Riches? and the like may be ſaid in other things. And as they cannot content the Soul, ſo they cannot ſecure the Body neither: If God do not more for the wealthieſt Man than all his Wealth can do, he will fall into miſchief every moment. Yea, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not procure him one good Night's reſt,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.18.</note> when he hath moſt need of it: Though <hi>Darius</hi> kept his Money, and his Kingdom too, yet it is ſaid, his ſleep went from him.</p>
                  <p>But there is a greater vanity than all this; for as the greateſt of this World's good cannot content a Man ſufficiently in proſperity, nor comfort him ſufficiently in adverſity, ſo it cannot ſecure him from Hell, or ſave him from Everlaſting Burnings: It cannot work his deliverance from it, nor prove his deliverance from it: The former is plain, and needs no proof: Though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ſell us Pardons for Money, yet they cannot aſſure us, that the one or the other can ſecure us from Hell. And the other is no leſs plain: for, we read expreſly, of a Rich man in Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and we find in <hi>Job,</hi> that God regardeth the Rich no more than the Poor. If he be ungodly, and dye ſo, he ſhall not come to Heaven, becauſe he had the World at will. And if he go to Hell, what will all his former comforts be to him, or how will the Remembrance of them comfort him? What will it be to live in eaſe for a time, if afterwards they live in Torment for ever? What will it be to have Honour for a while, if afterwards they ſuffer Everlaſting contempt? What will it be to be clothed with Silk or Silver, and to fare deliciouſly every Day, if afterwards they be clothed with Helliſh flames, and drink of the Cup of God's fiery Indignation? In a word, what will it be to enjoy the World, and miſs of Heaven, or in our Saviour's phraſe, <hi>to gain the whole World, and loſe their Souls?</hi> Lord, put me not off with earthly enjoyments, let not any thing be my portion that may conſiſt with thy diſpleaſure.</p>

(And therefore they will not be at the pains of being ſeriouſly Religious, becauſe they hope to do well enough without ſo much ado) But thoſe of them that dye ſuch as they have lived, and ſo come to Hell, will fail of what they hoped for, and loſe all the hopes of it. <hi>The hope of unjuſt men periſheth, Prov.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Prov. 11.7.

                     <p>HAving ſpoken of the Privative part of the Damneds miſery,<note place="margin">Poſitive Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</note> or the loſſes they ſhall ſuſtain, I ſhall now Treat, with God's Aſſiſtance, of the Poſitive miſery that they ſhall ſuffer: And firſt,<note place="margin">Bodily Pain.</note> they ſhall ſuffer extream pain in their Bodies. The extremity of it is plainly intimated in this, that they ſhall go <hi>into everlaſting fire, Matth.</hi> 25.41. Fire we know is the moſt Tormenting creature, the pains that are cauſed by it are moſt ſharp of any, and therefore the Papiſts have ſo much delight to torture the Hereticks, as they call them, by Burning, and to oppoſe their obſtinacy with Faggot-Arguments; And doubtleſs if they had not had a good God and a good Cauſe on their ſide, they could not poſſibly have withſtood them. A ſmall fire can fill a man with pains intolerable, though no more but one finger be ſcorched with it. A man would not be content to live one year in a burning Brick Kiln, if he might gain the wealth of a hundred Kingdoms, and be ſure to enjoy it a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. And we may eaſily aſſure our ſelves that Hell fire will be more grievous than any other for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſuch as is prepared on purpoſe for puniſhment,<note place="margin">Hell-fire worſe than any other.</note> and the product of God's fierceſt wrath, and therefore muſt needs be of a more tormenting nature than our ordinary fire, which is the effect of his gracious Providence, and was made for the help and comfort of mankind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Saints themſelves may be afflicted with other fire, (and the greateſt of them have been ſo) but Hell fire is proper and peculiar to the wicked; and ſure that evil muſt needs be worſer which is proper to the enemies of God, than that which his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may be afflicted with. To which I may add this alſo, that it is ſuch a fire as the evil Angels ſhall ſuffer in,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> [prepared for the Devil and his Angels.]</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall ſay, perhaps Hell-fire is not a real corporeal Fire, but ſomewhat elſe figuratively expreſſed by the name of fire: <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 'Tis lawful to ſuppoſe that it is real fire, and the abſurdities that my

And if the word Fire were figurative, it would be no matter of relief to the Damned's miſeries, but rather an aggravation of them: For thoſe things that are figuratively expreſſed in Scripture, do commonly exceed thoſe things by which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; As God, who is called a Father, for his love to his People, is more loving than any earthly Father, and Heaven, which is called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, is more glorious and bleſſed than ever Paradiſe was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Names of Hell.</note>And as Hell is called Fire abſolutely in that Text, ſo it is called elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, a <hi>Furnace of Fire,</hi> (a terrible word indeed) and (which is more terrible) <hi>a Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> O how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful muſt that place and ſtate be ſuppoſed to be, which is ſet forth unto us by ſuch dreadful names in holy Scripture! See <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41, 42. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                     <p>So (to name no more) it is called a <hi>Priſon.</hi> As Heaven is ſet out by things delightful, ſo Hell is ſet out by that which is diſtaſtful and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, amongſt which a Priſon is one, and Hell is called ſo, in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.19. And it is the worſt of Priſons, if we conſider the properties of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">A Priſon.</note>1. It is a dark Priſon. Darkneſs is naturally an uncomfortable thing: They that fear nothing in the light, yet are apt to be afraid of every thing when they are alone in the dark. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Companions had but an unpleaſant ſailing, when neither Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them for ſeveral Days together.

                     <p n="2">2. It is a faſt Priſon, ſuch as they that are once in, ſhall never be able to get out of: The Doors of it are ſhut upon them by the Juſtice, Truth and Power of the Almighty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a tormenting Priſon: Other Priſons are places where the Malefactors are reſerved for Puniſhment, but may have ſome eaſe and comforts during their aboad therein; But Hell-Priſon is the place of Puniſhment, where the wrath of God is executed continually upon his Enemies: I ſay continually, for they <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with an everlaſting</hi> (and therefore an ever-continuing) <hi>deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>

                     <p>The Doctrines of the Holy God were grievous to them, though they heard of them but now and then; What intolerable grief may the diſpleaſure of God cauſe in them, when they lye under it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?</p>
                     <p>And the more dreadful will this Priſon be to the Slaves of Satan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be (if I may ſo call it) a convincing Priſon unto them: Therein they ſhall be made to ſee their deſerts, as well as to feel their Puniſhment. Though they ſhall have no light of comfort there, yet they ſhall have a light of conviction. The Lord Jeſus (at the Day of Judgment) <hi>ſhall come from Heaven to convince all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds:</hi> And doubtleſs,<note place="margin">Jude 14.15.</note> that conviction will remain upon them when they are in Hell.</p>
                     <p>They will then be able to know, what it was that they are ſent thither for, and that they are ſo miſerable, not meerly for God's good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but for their own evil doings; for obeying the Devil more than God, for chuſing the ways of wickedneſs before his holy pleaſant Paths, for rejecting the counſels of his Word, and refuſing to return, that they might live; They will then be able enough to underſtand, that it was their loving of Darkneſs (or Ignorance) better than Light, that made Chriſt ſay unto them, <hi>I know you not,</hi> and to caſt them into that black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs eternally: Their miſchievous deſigns and ſpightful dealings that hath laid them under the Vengeance of God, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devil; their mocking at Religion, and laughing at Reproofs, that hath moved God to laugh at their Calamity, and mock at all their Woes and Cries: Their Heatheniſh liberty on God's Holy-day, that hath made them to be bound in thoſe Chains of Damnation; The Pride and Profaneneſs, and Unconſcionableneſs of their Hearts, the cruelty and injuſtice of their hands, the Deceit, Hypocriſie and Baſeneſs of their Tongues, with all their witty fine-mouth'd Railings, that brought them to that place of Torment, and made their Bloud and Bones ſo Hot in that everlaſting fiery Priſon. — I might add more of their Bodies miſery, but I ſhall paſs to that which is greater, the miſeries of their Souls; for as they were moſt in ſin, ſo they will be alſo moſt in Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>If a Man were never ſo full of pain in his Body,<note place="margin">The miſery of their Souls.</note> yet if his Soul have ſome reſt and comfort, he is very far from perfect miſery: But alas, it will not be ſo with the damned in Hell, their Souls will be as far from eaſe as their Bodies: for they will be afflicted perpetually with all ſorts of tormenting paſſions; and that,</p>

And that thy Reaſon (as well as thy faith) may have ſome ſatisfaction in the caſe, I ſhall lay down theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is in God <hi>Bonitas Regiminis,</hi> as well as <hi>Beneficentiae.</hi> In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thus: There is in God the goodneſs of a Governour, and the goodneſs of a Benefactor; now his puniſhing the wicked with Eternal Damnation is not at all contrary to his goodneſs in either of theſe ſences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis plain, It is not contrary to the goodneſs of his Government; He is the great Governour of the World, and therefore is called a <hi>King, a great King, the King eternal, &amp;c.</hi> in Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Malac. 1.14. 1 Tim. 1.17. Cap. 6.15.</note> and as he is ſuch, it belongeth to him to puniſh obſtinate and impenitent offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, according to their deſerts; and without this, the goodneſs of his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54321:75"/>
Government, namely, the wiſdom and righteouſneſs of it, would not be diſcovered to his Creatures: Even amongſt Men, they are not accounted good Governours, that do not puniſh the diſobedient, according to their deſerts, and maintain the honour of Government thereby: And if a Man ſuppoſe that the wicked do not deſerve to be puniſhed for ever, who would gladly be wicked for ever, he little knows what wickedneſs is; and the equity of this diſpenſation hath been cleared in the firſt Chapter of this Book, (towards the end of it.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the goodneſs of God's nature, that he hates ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; 'Tis his Excellency that he cannot look on iniquity: (elſe he were not a Holy God, and without Holineſs he could not be a God indeed: for his Holineſs is Eſſential to him, and therefore when he would ſwear by himſelf, he ſwears by his Holineſs.) Now if the goodneſs of his nature doth make him to hate ſin, it cannot be any diſparagement to his goodneſs to puniſh it accordingly, ſince the puniſhing of it is but the juſt demonſtration of his hatred againſt it; and he that ſhall go about to argue the contrary, will ſhew himſelf a bad Logician, and a worſe Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If it were not contrary to his goodneſs to threaten Everlaſting Puniſhment and Deſtruction to the wicked,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 2 Theſſ. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Theſe Learned Objectors ſhould not act ſo unlearnedly, as to argue the doing of that upon the account of his goodneſs, which cannot be done upon the account of his wiſdome, nor complain of his caſting thoſe into Hell, whom his wiſdome ſees to be utterly unfit for Heaven; The Enemies of God and Holineſs are not fit to dwell in his Holy place, [A Swine is fitter for a Prince's Preſence-chamber, than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Soul for Heaven.] And if Hell be fitter for them than Heaven, 'tis fit that they ſhould be ſent to Hell, rather than Heaven; for 'tis fit they ſhould have what is fitteſt for them: If an ungodly Man ſhould be brought to Heaven, it would be little comfort to him; yea, I doubt not, but he would count it a miſery, if he ſhould come there in ſuch a ſtate: The imperfect graces of his People on Earth, as diſcovered in gracious practiſes, are matter of trouble and grief unto him, and he had rather be amongſt the Beaſts of the Field, than be in company with thoſe that would move him to be Holy in good earneſt; How contrary
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54321:75"/>
then would the Holineſs of God be unto him, and what a vexation would it be to him to ſee thoſe glorified, whom he ſo much delighted to vilifie and diſgrace, to ſee thoſe ſilly preciſe ones (as he counted them) ſitting with <hi>Christ</hi> upon his Throne, whom he thought more worthy to be trodden under foot by ſuch as he? Thus miſerable would an ungodly Man be in Heaven, and is it not fitter that he ſhould be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in Hell? Is it not more proper and congruous, that he ſhould torment himſelf in the place of Torment, than in the place of Glory and Bleſſedneſs?</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, Let me tell the Objector, that God will ſufficiently appear to be good in a way of Beneficence alſo, though the wicked be under Everlaſting Condemnation. This is ſo plain, that I need not ſpend much time in the proof of it: for it would not be accounted a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, that a King on Earth ſhould be charged with unmercifulneſs, for condemning of Rebels to perpetual Impriſonment: He will appear a gracious and bountiful King for all that; while he takes care of the honour and ſafety of his true Subjects. Thus will the King of Heaven appear to be bountiful and gracious, and abundant in goodneſs, in his gracious dealings towards all his faithful Servants. 2. He is very boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the wicked themſelves, yea to the very worſt of them, here in this World. He gives them that Breath which they ſo often breathe out to his diſhonour, and the reproach of his Goſpel. He gives them all that time which now they miſpend, and thoſe precious means of grace, which they ſo unthankfully deſpiſe and abuſe; He gives them drink to quench their thirſt, though they drown their reaſon with it, and preſerves them every minute and moment from many ſecret and unknown dangers, beſides thoſe that are open and viſible: in which reſpect he is ſaid to be the Saviour of all Men.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.10.</note> Yea he gives them time to repent, and promiſes of mercy, when they unfeignedly return from ſin to his ſervice; in <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for the Number of them that periſh, which <hi>Coelius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Number of the Damned.</note> and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> think ſo ſtrangely of, we may eaſily perceive it is not ſo much to be wondered at, nor may not be imagined to be any diſparagement to the Divine Goodneſs. A ſober Chriſtian may receive ſome ſatisfaction from the words of his Lord, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.14.—<hi>Broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat.</hi> Is it fit theſe Men ſhould make a queſtion of that which their Lord (who is Truth it ſelf) hath ſo poſitively told us?</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, I ſhall add a few Conſiderations, to rectifie our thoughts hereabouts, that on that account we may not charge our God fooliſhly. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54321:76"/>1. How many ſoever they be that periſh, yet none of God's true ſervants ever ſhall:<note place="margin">John 10.28.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ will give them eternal life, and they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh:</hi> John 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe many that periſh were all out of the way of Salvation, and would not be perſwaded to turn into it, by a true Converſion. What wonder, if Deſtruction and Miſery be their end, when they are in their ways, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Deſtruction and miſery are in their ways, and the way of peace they have not known.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that chuſeth to travail in a Ship that is bound for <hi>Spain,</hi> may not wonder if at laſt he comes thither. As little cauſe have we to wonder that they ſhould have Hell for their end, that make wickedneſs (in ſome kind or other) their common way, and will not conſent unfeignedly to turn into the Holy Path; And that this is the caſe of the moſt among us, is ſo ſadly apparent, that I may lawfully ſpare the pains of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is no diſparagement to the goodneſs of a King or Judge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn common Robbers or Murderers, nor to condemn many of them: Yea, Juſtice requires him ſo to do, and their Multitude can be no reaſon at all to excuſe them in their wickedneſs: If theſe Men ſhould meet with many to abuſe them, (though it were only in words) and one ſhould ſay, you need not take it ill, ſeeing there are many that do ſo, they would not think very well of his ſpeech: And muſt the juſt Judge of the whole World, ſpare the wicked and impenitent, becauſe there are many of them? If ſo, how ſhall the Judge of the World do right? for all the World knows, that were not Righteouſneſs, nor any thing like it. And if that any Man could prove, that 'tis unreaſonable that many impenitent ſinners ſhould be ſent to Hell, he might as wiſely prove that 'tis ſo for any at All to be ſent thither: For, if many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under the ſame guilt deſerve not the ſame Puniſhment, a few that are ſo, do not deſerve it neither: The Number doth not alter the Caſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It cannot be denied, but the greateſt part of Men by far is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungodly and unconſcionable, ſenſual and diſobedient: and it muſt needs be granted that ſuch are fitter for Hell and puniſhment, than for Heaven and happineſs, and the delightful fruition of the Holy God: And it is not to be queſtioned, but the moſt of the wicked continue ſuch ſtill. Muſt a Man believe that the Enemies of God and holineſs will be in love with God and holineſs, becauſe they are the greateſt Number? If one Man, that dyeth unconverted, may go to Heaven, we may as well ſuppoſe that another may, and another again, and ſo of others ſtill;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54321:76"/>
So that either we muſt ſuppoſe, that all that dye in their ſins go to Hell, or elſe none; and which is moſt like to be true, they that know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures may eaſily apprehend.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If Mens judgments were not blinded by guilt and ſelfiſhneſs, they would think it more wonderful, that God ſhould ſuffer ſuch a Deluge of wickedneſs to go unpuniſhed in this World, than that he ſhould pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, according to its deſert, in another World.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. What if God ſhould ſend but one wicked Man of a Thouſand to Hell, and ſave all the reſt, would they not acknowledge and admire his Mercy and Beneficence? Well, though he will not do ſo, yet we know not, but there may be as great a communication of his goodneſs, as that amounts to. For as the Heaven of glory doth incomparably exceed the inferiour Heavens and Earth in bigneſs; So it is judged by ſober, learned Men, that there be ten thouſand times more holy and bleſſed Spirits there, than there be wicked Men in Earth or Hell; and they were as wiſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> and others.</note> as other Men, that ſuppoſed the Planets, and other Luminaries of Heaven, to be inhabited by Spirits, as the Earth is by Men, and Beaſts. And when I obſerve that all places (almoſt) here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, both in Air and Water, as well as Earth, are inhabited by Birds, or Flies, or Fiſhes, or ſome other living Creatures, I am very willing to imagine, that the more glorious parts of God's handy-work, which ſo dazle our eyes but a little to behold, are not empty, but poſſeſſed by ſuch excellent Inhabitants, as are ſuitable to their magnitude and glory. Thou knoweſt not, <hi>Reader,</hi> how many Millions of Creatures are over thy head, that are filled with their Maker's love and goodneſs, and therefore entertain no hard thoughts of it, nor murmur at the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy God, upon the obſtinate Enemies of his holy Laws, how many ſoever they may be.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have anſwered the Objection aforeſaid, and may now fitly proceed to a farther improvement of the Doctrine pleaded for, in a way of Exhortation and Caution to ſeveral ſorts of Men; of which with God's leave, in the enſuing Paragraph.</p>

                  <p>HAving proved the point ſo plainly before, and cleared it now at large from the grand objection about its conſiſtency with the Divine Goodneſs, I ſhall urge it (by God's permiſſion) upon ſeveral ſorts of men amongſt us. And I may fitly urge it upon thoſe in the firſt place, that are firſt in place, <hi>viz.</hi> The Gentry of our Land—</p>
                  <p>I need not doubt but ſome or other will think me a pragmatical perſon (in the very worſt ſenſe,) and may be willing to ask me what I have to do with ſuch? Well, if they have any great deſire to do ſo, let them do it by all means, for why ſhould they loſe their longing? But if they are reaſonable men, I may hope to prevent that query by giving them this following account, in brief:</p>
                  <p>Namely, that I am a debtor to all, and am bound (eſpecially as I am a Miniſter) to do good to all ſo far as I may: and it is as much worth my pains to endeavour to prevent the damnation of theſe, as to prevent the Damnation of meaner men; for their Souls are as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their ſins as dangerous as others. And it is very proper to ſpeak ſomewhat to ſuch perſons, becauſe they are moſt taken notice of, and their Examples moſt powerful to lead others in the way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deſtruction.</p>

                        <hi>1.</hi> To the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Gentry.</note>There be two ſorts of Gentry amongſt us. 1. Senſual careleſs ones. 2. Serious and Conſcientious.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the former, and certainly I had need be careful how I ſpeak to thoſe men that have ruined ſo many that never durſt to ſpeak to them ſo plainly as I intend to do.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Who are ſuch.</note>But before I go any further, I muſt expreſs my ſelf clearly, and ſhew whom I mean by Senſual Gentry, even thoſe that take more care how to pleaſe their ſenſes, and ſenſitive Appetites, than their Conſciences or their God; that make more account of Gain than Godlineſs, and regard not who or how many they ruine, ſo they may but raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it; that ſlight the Laws of the Eternal King, and care no more for a plain (ſound) Sermon than for a diſh of ſtinking meat;

                     <hi>[See that ye walk circumſpectly, redeeming the time]</hi> is no Precept of mine, but of the Apoſtle,<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 5.15, 16.</note> or rather of God by him; and if Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not concerned with it, it would be hard to prove that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are. Believe me, Sirs, your time is one of your choiceſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor can you name any thing, beſides God's grace, and your Souls, that can be compared with it for preciouſneſs; What would you not give for another years time, in order to your preparation for an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life, in caſe you were to dye to morrow? And though I am not concerned to accuſe you of miſpending your time, yet I may lawfully put you in mind of it, and deſire you to call your ſelves to account for it, before your God doth. Compare, I beſeech you, the time that you
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54321:79"/>
ſpend in exceſſive ſleeping, in trimming and adorning, in feaſting and long meals, in pomp and ſtate and vain curioſity, in vain thoughts and worldly cares, in Cards and Dice, and other Games, (at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad) in fruitleſs and unedifying Books, in idle company and needleſs viſits, in vain diſcourſes and delights, in doing ill, or doing nothing; I ſay, do but compare this time that is ſpent in theſe ways, with that time which is ſpent in a ſerious ſeeking and ſerving of God, in reading of good Books, in thinking of good things, in governing your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies religiouſly, in relieving the poor, in encouraging your Charge in the ways of God, or any thing elſe that tends to the promoting of piety, in your ſelves, or others; And let your own conſciences tell you which is moſt: For in many of our Gentry, the time that is ſpent in the latter, is no more in compariſon of that which is ſpent upon the former, than the poor Man's wages for a days work, to their Yearly Incomes; Their whole buſineſs and work is ſports and paſtimes, ſo that we might deſcribe them in thoſe words, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. [They are a People that ſat down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play] But ſuch provide but ill for themſelves; nor can it be ſafe for them to be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of time, that have Death and Judgment before them, a Hell to eſcape, and a Heaven to prepare for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is another ſin, that ſome who go for Gentlemen are ſadly in love with,<note place="margin">Raſh Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> (and muſt not be forgotten in this Diſcourſe) I mean horrid Swearing and Imprecations, Damning, Sinking, and the like. And ſurely if Damnation be a real thing, and not a Dream, it muſt needs be a damnable thing, (in the higheſt ſenſe) raſhly and profanely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate it upon themſelves. What wonder is it, if theſe Men have Hell for their portion, that commonly have Damnation it ſelf for the matter of their prayer! And if they did only ſhame themſelves by this wickedneſs, the matter were not ſo much; but they (alas) ſhame their profeſſion alſo, and bring a grievous reproach upon the holy Prayers of our Church. 'Tis the corrupt Lives and curſed Speeches of ſuch Profeſſors, that harden the deluded <hi>Separatists</hi> in their prejudice againſt them, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſuch like: I read, not many Moneths ago, a paſſage to this purpoſe, (more than plain enough) in a <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet; where ſpeaking to ſome Perſons of this bad quality, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf after this manner: [You cry out, <hi>God damn us,</hi> and <hi>God confound us,</hi> and ſoon after you go to your Church, and ſay, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord.</hi>] Thus (Reader) this clauſe in our Letany, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> (than which it is hard to imagine any thing more humble, or pious, or better becoming a ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54321:80"/>
is matter of greateſt ſcorn and contempt to theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and all becauſe it is Profaned and Unhallowed by the peſtilent Tongues of theſe Hyperdiabolical Gentlemen, theſe Damnable Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sinking Gallants. O Sirs, if you are guilty of this ſin, conſider of it for the Lord's ſake, and do no more ſo wickedly. O that I might diſſwade you from it by any means; to that end I will propoſe unto you theſe Two queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">The Damners queſtioned.</note>1. What if you ſhould be pleaſed to lay aſide your Atheiſm, and adventure to believe that there is a God to whom vengeance belongeth? would you not then account it reaſonable to honour him by a better Prayer than [God damn us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and think it more needful to beg his mercy, than to imprecate his Vengeance? And if you think that there is no God, and that Religion is only a ſilly thing that came into the World by chance, through the force of fooliſh cauſeleſs fears (as ſome of your companions are willing to perſwade themſelves) It may be worth your while to Read and Conſider what that excellent Gentleman<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sir</hi> Charles Woolſley, p. 77.</note> hath replied unto it, in his moſt Rational diſcourſe of the unreaſonableneſs of Atheiſm, and to anſwer it if you can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What if you did but ſee that wicked Spirit that tempts you thus fearfully to challenge your Maker, and dare him to deſtroy you, would you not then take heed how you yield to his temptations, and follow his counſel? And is it not much worſe to feel damnation than to ſee the Devil? Why then ſhould you raſhly imprecate ſo great a miſchief upon your ſelves, and run the hazard of bearing that wrath we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured he doth tremble at<note n="*" place="margin">James 2.19.</note>?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What if you had been among thoſe Swaggerers in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Dr. <hi>B.</hi> in his Theatre of God's Judgments<note n="*" place="margin">p. 552.</note>, out of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Author<note n="*" place="margin">Jo. Fincelius.</note>, who having delighted themſelves in the night with profane Speeches and wicked wiſhes (much like that aforeſaid, though not quite ſo bad) were found dead in the morning, with their necks bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cruſhed as if a Cart-wheel had gone over them, with bloud alſo flowing out of their mouths and noſtrils to the aſtoniſhment of all that ſaw them. Surely had you ſeen this ſad Spectacle, you would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make ſo bold with the God of Judgment, as to dare him to deſtroy you. Well, if you will not be warned by ſuch examples your ſelves, he can make you examples to others: and if ſuch a death be dreadful, Damnation is worſe, incomparably worſe, how light ſoever you may make of it, (as you muſt needs grant if you believe there is any ſuch thing, if you do not, let it pleaſe you to vindicate your good friend Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and make good his Arguments againſt my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.)</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54321:80"/>4. What makes you to be ſo fearful when any extraordinary ſigns of God's power appear?<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.17, 18.</note> If his Thunder do but ſhake the Earth under you, if his Lightnings ſinge your well-ſet Hair, if a terrible Tempeſt overtake you in the field, and tear the Oaks in pieces under which you ſtand for ſhelter, your courage will fail, and your ſtouteſt hearts tremble as a Leaf, how then can you bear up under his fierceſt wrath, and endure that damnation which you ſo commonly and fearleſly impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate on your ſelves?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Damnation be ſo ſlight a matter as (by your ſpeeches) you ſeem to make of it, why are you commonly ſo much afraid of dying? They who walked in your ways, and talked in your Language (moſt ſtoutly and preſumptuouſly) yet ſpake very faintly when a deadly diſeaſe took hold of them: ſome of your Quality, when their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian told them they were not like to recover, fell into a horrrid rage, and could ſcarce forbear curſing him to his face. And yet Damnation is ten thouſand times dreadfuller than death, if all our Religion hath not deceived us. To lye in the place of darkneſs is as nothing to the living in the place of Torment. Read but the foregoing Chapter and you may ſee ſo much Terror in it, as might hinder you from wiſhing it upon your ſelves, though it were never ſo much in faſhion amongſt the Hectors of our Times. They would not delight themſelves in [Damn my Bloud] if they knew the fierceneſs of Hell-fire. (And if they can ſee themſelves ſo far in danger of it as to deſire heartily to eſcape it, they may fitly read ſome directions for that purpoſe in the latter pages of this Diſcourſe.)</p>
                  <p>If any expect an Apologie for what I have ſaid to theſe men, he is likely to be diſappointed of his expectation; and if they themſelves ſhall call me Stoick or Clown, or Puritan for my pains, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take it at their hands, and will (as I verily hope) ſay no worſe to them than I would to thoſe that are infected with the Plague, <hi>viz. The Lord be merciful unto you.</hi>—And now I leave them, being willing to ſpeak a few words to their Betters, namely, <hi>The Serious and Religious Gentry.</hi>

                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> I ſhall firſt tell you who I mean by <hi>Religious Gentry,</hi> and then ſpeak a word of Exhortation, with all humility unto them. For the former, The <hi>Religious Gentleman</hi> is one that minds his God above his Money, and placeth his Happineſs in a higher world than this he lives in; one that ſcorns nothing ſo much as ſin, and deſires nothing ſo much as a Conformity to Jeſus Chriſt, and an abſolute fruition of his Love and Glory; 'Tis his higheſt Ambition to be a Favourite in the Court of Heaven, and the beſt of his Buildings are diſeſteemed by him in compariſon of the many Manſions that are there; his Tongue keeps time and tune with his Mind and Conſcience, he doth not make or love a Lye (he looks upon ſuch Drolling as a piece of damnable fooling) he counts it no pride to make his boaſt of God, nor no ſhame to ſpeak often of his Attributes and Excellencies. He will glorifie his God in his body alſo, and therefore will not adventure to diſhonour him with the Apparel he puts upon it, (God having given him his right ſhape, he ſees no reaſon why he ſhould be mis-ſhapen by any monſtrous faſhions.)</p>
                  <p>In a word, as he is Religious, ſo he is not afraid to own and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Exerciſes of Religion, in publick as well as in private; He ſeeks not for the Golden mean between Saintſhip and Atheiſm, but is reſolved to be a Saint ſo far as he may, though the proud ſhould call
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54321:81"/>
him Puritan for it. He goes as joyfully to God's houſe as the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual gallants to a Play-houſe, and comes out with more as well as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction. He goes not to Church to ſave his Credit or his Purſe, to ſee Faſhions or to cenſure his Miniſter, but to diſcharge his Duty, and adorn his Profeſſion, to Serve his God and Save his Soul. (and therefore he had rather go Twice a day than Once a month) This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is the nature and quality of theſe excellent Perſons I am ſpeaking of, and however thou mayſt wonder at it, I dare affirm there are ſome ſuch to be found among us; and to them I am now (with all Chriſtian reſpectfulneſs) to addreſs my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Honoured Sirs, ſince <hi>Hell is no Fancy,</hi> ſince the miſeries thereof are real, intolerable, and eternal, give me lieve, I beſeech you, to urge upon you theſe following Duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Firſt Duty.</label> 1. To rejoyce in the Lord, and delight your ſelves in the Thoughts of his Great Goodneſs towards you. For he hath freed you for ever from all this Miſery. That Cloud of Vengeance which will fall upon the Careleſs Gallants at the laſt day, ſhall be far from you: You may meet with many diſtreſſes, but nothing of Damnation ſhall ever come near you, for there is <hi>no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 2. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him</hi> (to wit with a holy and True Faith, ſuch as is attended with a Religious life) <hi>ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>When the awakening Trumpet ſhall ſend forth its Echo's to the ends of the Earth, it ſhall be no matter of amazement unto you: when you ſhall look out of your Graves and ſee the Lord of Glory, Armed with irreſiſtible power, clothed with ſhining Majeſty, and flaming Vengeance, attended with all his Troops of holy Angels, (Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins and Seraphins) honoured with their loudeſt ſhouts, their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes, their joyfulleſt Acclamations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet then I ſay your hearts ſhall not fail, <hi>for you ſhall come forth to the Reſurrection of life, Joh.</hi> 5.29. and be raiſed up for heaven, not for hell; wherefore ſerve your God with gladneſs, and do not ſo much humor the Devil, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour this malignant world, as to be afraid of its enmity, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged at the worſt it can do againſt you: That Gracious God whom you ſerve is able to deliver you from all evils: and as he hath ſaved you from the power of ſin, and the puniſhment of Hell, ſo he will be your ſhield from ſmaller dangers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54321:82"/>
                  <p>
                     <label>Second Duty.</label> Secondly, To be often in the Heavenly Duty of Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. This Tribute you owe for every Mercy you partake of; how much more for your deliverance from the Everlaſting Puniſhment? Methinks, (Sirs,) you ſhould delight your ſelves abundantly in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and Praiſe your great deliverer with enlarged hearts. O let that be a main part of your work here, which ſhall be your Beatifying employment in the high and Holy place. When Senſualiſts are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in Songs of Lewdneſs and Vanity, let your hearts be delighted with Songs of Praiſe. If the Blind man in the Goſpel (<hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>ult.) could follow Chriſt ſo joyfully, glorifying God,</hi> merely becauſe he was cured of his blindneſs, O what Joyful Praiſes ſhould your hearts be filled with, and your glory (your Tongues) be exerciſed in, when you are ſaved through Chriſt from the Everlaſting Darkneſs and deſtruction, and ſhall ſhortly ſee an end of all your Sorrows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Third Duty.</label> Value not overmuch the Scorns and Cenſures of the ungodly world: fear not the reproach of men,<note place="margin">Eſay 51.7.</note> nor be afraid of their revilings (while you walk in the Holy way) No reaſon for it, for why ſhould they fear the contempt of any, that are ſecured from the everlaſting ſhame?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Fourth Duty.</label> Another duty which I would humbly exhort you to, is this, To do what you can to ſave others from Hell. Not that you can ſave them in a way of abſolute yower, by working ſaving Grace in their Souls, nor in a way of Merit, by procuring Heaven for them, This 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed you cannot do: But yet you may do that which the Scripture calls a Saving of them, namely, Perſwade them to be careful of their own Salvation, and occaſion them to uſe the means of Salvation that are afforded them. And what can be imagined more excellent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, or more truly worthy of a <hi>Religious Gentleman</hi> than this? Motives to it I might add in great variety, from the Glory of God, the Worth of the Soul, the Love of Chriſt, the Honour of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the honourableneſs of the Duty in it ſelf, (To conquer Towns and Caſtles, and Kingdoms, is but a poor and worthleſs project to the furious endeavours of Saving a Soul.) But methinks God's goodneſs to your ſelves might be a very powerful engagement upon you ſo to do, if there were no other reaſon for it. As the King in the Parable, <hi>Oughteſt thou not to have forgiven thy fellow-ſervant ſeeing I forgave thee?</hi> ſo may it be ſaid much more in this caſe, ought you not to do your beſt to ſave others from Hell, ſince your God hath been ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as to ſave you? — And I beſeech you, Sirs, let it be remembred what opportunities and advantages you have above other men, to do good to your Neighbours Souls. Your Place and Authority will bear a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54321:82"/>
great ſway with them, they will regard your words and examples, when they will not regard ours: Happy would many a poor Miniſter account himſelf, if his People would mind the commands of God, which he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth upon them in the name of Chriſt, half ſo much as they would mind the words of a Man of Place and Wealth. If you ſhew a love to a Church, and a plain Sermon, they will ſeem to do ſo for their credit ſake, and will not dare to call the one a Steeple-houſe, or the other a Puritanical Preachment.</p>
                  <p>Now you may be Inſtrumental to their Salvation (or deliverance from Hell) many ways, eſpecially theſe following. 1. In general, by your own example, by living godly, righteouſly and ſoberly in your general courſe. They will be more capable of believing profaneneſs, ſottiſhneſs and injurious doings to be hateful things, when they ſee them ſo carefully ſhunned by ſuch as you.</p>
                  <p>In particular, If you would be a means of ſaving your Neighbours Souls from Hell, let it pleaſe you to obſerve theſe following Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Endeavour to engage them to publick Duty, and to hear that word often, that is able to ſave their Souls. Shew your Zeal for the Solemn Service of your God, and let them know how greatly you love the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Houſe, and the place where his Honour dwelleth: This would be a means to bring them often thither, if not for love, yet for ſhame, and fear, and if they come within the ſound of God's Word, whatſoever it be that moves them ſo to do, there is hopes they may be the better for it, or at leaſt not ſo bad, (ſo blind, and bold, and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſin) as if they had been drinking, or prating with their ungodly Companions, when they ſhould be hearing the Word of their Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew your Zeal againſt Drunkenneſs, common Swearing, and all other groſs ſin, by puniſhing it according to the Laws of the Land, and to ſhew moſt of your favour and kindneſs to thoſe Perſons, or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that ſeem to have the greateſt kindneſs for Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To diſcourſe with your Neighbours in an edifying way. Let your ſpeech ſavour of Grace, and diſcover your ſeriouſneſs for your God and Souls. Let them know by your words, the holy temper of your hearts: Tell them how glad you would be to be more holy than you are, to be perfectly conformed to the will of Chriſt, and how little you value all this World's good, in compariſon of his love, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in Heavenly glory: Tell them what thoughts you have of the ſtate of an ungodly Profeſſor, and that you would not be in ſuch a caſe for all the Wealth in the Earth: Tell them of the preciouſneſs of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54321:83"/>
Time, and the greatneſs of that work which they muſt do for their Souls therein, and if they ſeem careleſs of it, ask them ſeriouſly ſome awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Queſtions; As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do you not know that you are Men, and that your reaſon was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you to make you capable of ſerving your God with a reaſonable ſervice, (that is, a ready, willing, and conſcionable ſervice.) And do you not know that he is always preſent with you, and pondereth all your goings?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do you not know you muſt ſhortly dye, and your Souls enter immediately into an endleſs ſtate of joy or ſorrow, according as you dye, godly, or ungodly Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doth not God deſerve infinitely more than your higheſt love, your beſt obedience? The Heavens declare his glory, and may it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you to forget him, and live to his diſhonour?</p>
                  <p>Do you not admire the beauty and brightneſs of the ſtarry Heaven, and will you venture to loſe all the glory and joy which dwells in the Heaven of Heavens, for the tranſitory pleaſures or profits of ſin? O how much good might a few of ſuch queſtions (or ſpeeches) do from a Gentleman's mouth upon his Tenents, or Neighbours Souls.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. Engage them in the reading of Scripture, and ſuch Books as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and apply the great truths and duties in it, as Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Rules of <hi>Holy Living,</hi> the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Books of <hi>Death and Judgment,</hi> or any other that your Prudence and Piety ſhall think fit for them. Such private innocent companions (I doubt not) have been a means of ſaving many a Soul. Engage them alſo to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of Prayer, by themſelves, and with their Families: for the often approaching to God in ſo holy a work (whether with a Book, or without) will ſhame them from groſs ſins, and make them more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their proviſions for Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do all you adviſe them to your ſelves, and be ready to do good to their Bodies and Names, in any reaſonable way, as well as to their Souls, and then there is no doubt, but your good Examples, and good Counſels, may do them good. And your labour (in all) will not be too much, in ſo great a work, as the ſaving of Souls from the ſecond Death.</p>
                  <p>My next work is to Exhort All in general, high and low, rich and poor, (one with another.)</p>
                  <p>Surely, my Brethren, you had need be heedful to your ſelves, ſince Hell is real; O conſider your ways, and uſe all poſſible means to eſcape the Damnation of Hell. I hope I ſhall not need to add any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54321:83"/>
Motives to it, if you believe its dreadfulneſs, and your own deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; And as for Directions for it, the following Section will ſupply you with them.</p>

He that lyeth in an infected bed, and hopeth that he is in no danger of the Diſeaſe becauſe his Smell and Taſte is good, or on any the like inſufficient ground and reaſon, is not only never a whit the ſafer for his hope, but is really ſo much the more in danger; becauſe he contents himſelf with his dangerous condition, and concludes his ſafety from that which will not warrant any ſuch concluſion.

He that is in the way towards hell, and yet hath a ſtrong hope (upon unſound grounds) that he is not in danger of it, is not the ſafer becauſe he hopes, but the more in danger becauſe he hopes upon unſound grounds: here therefore I ſhall name ſome ſandy foundations upon which ſinners may be apt to build their hope of eſcaping hell torments; that ſo they may not reſt in them, but ſeek for better, by a true and thorough returning to the Lord.— Now their falſe hopes of eſcaping it are grounded eſpecially upon theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">The ſinner's falſe hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</note>1. Riches and Worldly proſperity. Some doubtleſs are willing to make this an Argument of their eſcaping hell; Surely (they think) that God that is ſo good to them now in this world as to give them the good things thereof in ſo great abundance, will not be ſo hard to them as to ſend them to hell at laſt (though they go on in ſin, and hate to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) they hope they may ſafely conclude he will not preſs them with his fierce wrath hereafter, becauſe he loadeth them ſo much with his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits here. But how plauſible ſoever ſuch Reaſonings may ſeem at firſt view, I am ſure they are not ſound: for how can that be any ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Salvation, which the worſt in hell did ſometime partake of? as, <hi>Pharaoh, Herod, Nero, Julian, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe 'tis confeſſed were as Rich &amp; Great in the World as moſt men ever were, and yet we do not believe they are ſaved. The <hi>Pope</hi> (good man) hath wealth enough (if he could but think ſo) yet no underſtanding Proteſtant will ſay, that therefore his Holineſs muſt needs be a Saint, and be Saved infallibly (becauſe He is rich.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Worldly Troubles and Croſſes. As ſome hope to eſcape hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments becauſe they are Rich and Proſperous, ſo others (on the contrary) hope ſo, becauſe they are Poor and Afflicted in the world: they have been poor and mean, and deſpiſed, (a long time) and therefore ſince they have their hell here (as they uſe to ſpeak) they verily perſwade themſelves they are in no danger of hell hereafter.—And theſe men are juſt as wiſe as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54321:85"/>
the former, or rather as vain; for what place of Scripture ſaith, that he that is poor and afflicted here, ſhall therefore be ſaved hereafter, or that none who are ſuch may ever periſh, or the like? Doth it not threaten Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the ungodly in general? or may ſome of the ungodly be excuſed, becauſe they are poor and afflicted? Are they not ſo much the leſs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, if they will walk contrary to the Lord, when his hand is heavy upon them? And therefore when you read that God will ſave the poor, and the like, in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> you muſt underſtand it either of the poor in ſpirit, the humble and contrite-hearted Man, or elſe of the poor that are ſober, pious and peaceable, as well as poor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moral honeſty in their common dealings with their Neighbours, freedome from groſs and ſcandalous ſins, performing of outward duties of Religion, hearing at Church, reading at home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do all this, ſay ſome, and therefore we do not doubt, but we are delivered from Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But (by their leaves) all this will not prove it; for, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now he that goes no farther than ſo, doth not exceed them in righteouſneſs. That they were (many of them) honeſt in their dealings, and free from ſcandalous ſins, is ſo plain, that it may ſeem needleſs to prove it; <hi>Ye are they that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie your ſelves before men,</hi> (ſpeaking to theſe People) <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Nor can we think our Saviour would have ſpoken thus, [the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees] if they had had no righteouſneſs at all, if they had been groſly unrighteous and abominable, common Cheaters, Drunkards, Railers, or the like. And that they did uſe to obſerve the outward viſible duties of Religion is no leſs plain: We have mention made of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Alms, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and elſewhere. How ſtrict were they about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? What a ſeeming zeal for the publick worſhip was to be found in them?

(which ye ought to have done, ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, if our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants dare believe him) <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Theſe were ſome of the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were tythable, yea it was doubted by ſome whether they were tythable or not; yet they for their part would be ſure to pay them, leſt they ſhould ſeem to rob God and Church, by withholding them.

                  <p n="2">2.

God, to whom vengeance belongeth, will avenge himſelf upon them, <hi>and puniſh them with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction from his preſence,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let me hence add a word to the godly in general; let them be exhorted to grow (more and more) 1. In Grace and holy obedience; for what love, what ſervice, what obedience can ever be ſuitable to that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God which ſaves them (through Chriſt) from the everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment their ſins deſerve? We may well exhort them to all holy duties, by the mercies of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. They can never do too much for his Glory, that hath done ſo much for their Salvation, <hi>for he will give them eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In comfort and ſpiritual joy: <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to ſuch, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1. Chriſt is their all-ſufficient Saviour, and <hi>they ſhall ſurely be ſaved from wrath through him, Rom.</hi> 5.9. why ſhould any worldly Troubles trouble them overmuch, ſince they ſhall have none in the world to come? Death can do no more than rot them, and hell no more than fright them. Rejoyce therefore, O faithful Chriſtian, and give thanks at the remembrance of the goodneſs of thy God; the joy of the Lord is thy ſtrength, O let it be thy work too. Yea, moſt certainly, it ſhall be ſo at the coming of Chriſt to judgment. <hi>He will then receive thee to himſelf: Joh.</hi> 14.3. His love ſhall then be ſtronger than death, and conquer the laſt enemy for thee. Thou ſhalt be filled with Joy and Glory, when the wicked ſhall have their fill of ſhame and ſorrow; and ſhalt be accepted graciouſly with him, when all the enemies of his Holineſs ſhall be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his Preſence, and be buried alive in everlaſting fire.—And now bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, for all his gracious Providences, and, in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, for all his gracious Aſſiſtances in this ſmall Work! —</p>
